# Bootcamp


First week of master, first attempt to understand myself better.
I'm understanding that the process of knowing myself can generate a design action.
Being in control and processing my personal development, the changes I went and I go through and my growth in connection with the environment I live in, can help me to focus on how I see design should be and define my ethic of design.
I wanna put my personal identity in the context of my visions in order to be fully involved.
