# Bio & Agri Zero


A picture that represents my journey with Nuria and Jordi through Bio and Agri Zero weeks.
That day we were making bio plastic (which are not the solution okay?) but after some hours of listening to bio plastic theory, using our hands, brains and recipes to actually make some felt incredible.

During the two weeks, it felt good to learn science and chemistry in an active and creative way.

#Bees under stress


Stress: noun - a state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or demanding circumstance // great worry caused by a difficult situation, or something that causes this condition.

And yes, not just humans and other mammals can feel stressed, but also bees.

The articles that I want to discuss claims that *Bees get stressed at work too and it might be causing colony collapse*, (published in June 2018) and *Museum collections indicate bees increasingly stressed by changes in climate* (August 2022).
