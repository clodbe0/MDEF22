# Bio & Agri Zero


A picture that represents my journey with Nuria and Jordi through Bio and Agri Zero weeks.
That day we were making bio plastic (which are not the solution okay?) but after some hours of listening to bio plastic theory, using our hands, brains and recipes to actually make some felt incredible.

During the two weeks, it felt good to learn science and chemistry in an active and creative way.

#Bees get stressed


Stress: noun - a state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or demanding circumstance // great worry caused by a difficult situation, or something that causes this condition.

And yes, not just humans and other mammals can feel stressed, but also bees.

The articles that I want to discuss claims that *Bees get stressed at work too and it might be causing colony collapse*, (published in June 2018) and *Museum collections indicate bees increasingly stressed by changes in climate* (August 2022).

That animals feel emotions and moods we can take for granted: emotions is not just an internal awareness of a feeling, but also a physical and behavior change.

The emotional life of animals, insects and specifically bees has been studied for a long time, and it showed impressive results: bees don't experience human-like emotions, but it feels like something to be an insect.

Some recent studies by Geraldine Wright at Newcastle University in the UK have showed that honeybees may experience something akin to moods. They proved that bees show a state of negative affect triggered by agitation, "associated with system-wide changes in neurotransmitters and causes clear, measurable cognitive biases".

But what does cause stress to bees?
The shape of the hive can be a cause: Open Source Beehives designed a hive that encourages happiness for health bees, by reducing the stress. The shape of common hives aim to maximize the honey production. This one instead allow bees to build their combs in more natural curving shapes.

Also, when a parasite infect the hive, they produce a warning pheromone to communicate the danger to each other, and this pheromone itself cause a social stress. Yes, bees are social insects and as most of them they use pheromone to communicate! Insects have been using pheromones for communications throughout evolutionary history. Chemical communication help insects to be organized inside the colonies.

But if the threat is bigger than a parasite, let's say a big animal, or a human, the bees are gonna produce a bigger quantity of pheromone.

And what is this pheromone? Bees release it when they sting, when they're killed, to take care of other individuals, but they use it also to mark flowers after they removed the nectar. It is basically a call to action used for collective decision making and rapid communication in the community. And it can work in a repelling or attracting way.

*“If the social harmony gets disrupted, it can cause colony collapse, meaning complete dysfunction of the hive.”* Christopher Mayack says.


Another cause of stress is the intense foraging:
