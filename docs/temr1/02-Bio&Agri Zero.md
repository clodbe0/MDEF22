# Bio & Agri Zero


A picture that represents my journey with Nuria and Jordi through Bio and Agri Zero weeks.
That day we were making bio plastic (which are not the solution okay?) but after some hours of listening to bio plastic theory, using our hands, brains and recipes to actually make some felt incredible.

During the two weeks, it felt good to learn science and chemistry in an active and creative way.

#Honeybees get stressed
Why honeybees get stressed? And does stress affect colony collapse disorder?



Stress: noun - a state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or demanding circumstance // great worry caused by a difficult situation, or something that causes this condition // physiological concept that allows organisms to respond to adverse environmental pressures.

And yes, not just humans and other mammals can feel stressed, but also honeybees.

The articles that I want to discuss claims that *Bees get stressed at work too and it might be causing colony collapse*, (published in June 2018 by The Conversation).

That animals feel emotions and moods we can take for granted: emotions is not just an internal awareness of a feeling, but also a physical and behavior change.

The emotional life of animals, insects and specifically bees has been studied for a long time, and it showed impressive results: bees don't experience human-like emotions, but it feels like something to be an insect.

Some recent studies by Geraldine Wright at Newcastle University in the UK have showed that honeybees may experience something akin to moods. They proved that bees show a state of negative affect triggered by agitation, *"associated with system-wide changes in neurotransmitters and causes clear, measurable cognitive biases"*.

**But what does cause stress to honeybees?**
Stress in bees has been studied throughout the reaction of multiple aspects as behavioral, physiological or cellular stress responses. And, as it happens to human, stressors affect the immune system, causing ripple effect. Here are some causes of stress in bees.

The shape of the hive can be a cause: Open Source Beehives designed a hive that encourages happiness for health bees, by reducing the stress. The shape of common hives aim to maximize the honey production. This one instead allow bees to build their combs in more natural curving shapes.

Also, when a parasite infect the hive, they produce a warning **pheromone** to communicate the danger to each other, and this pheromone itself cause a social stress. But if the threat is bigger than a parasite, let's say a big animal, or a human, the bees are gonna produce a bigger quantity of pheromone.
Yes, bees are social insects and as most of them they use pheromone to communicate! Insects have been using pheromones for communications throughout evolutionary history. Chemical communication help insects to be organized inside the colonies.

*“If the social harmony gets disrupted, it can cause colony collapse, meaning complete dysfunction of the hive.”* Christopher Mayack says.

And what is this pheromone? Bees release it when they sting, when they're killed, to take care of other individuals, but they use it also to mark flowers after they removed the nectar. It is basically a call to action used for collective decision making and rapid communication in the community. And it can work in a repelling or attracting way.

Another cause of stress is the intense foraging:

**And what does stress have to do with the colony collapse disorder?** This syndrome has been affecting bees increasingly over the past 15 years and is *"the result of an accumulation of stressors chronically weakening honey bee colonies"*. The stressors that are causing an increase in honey bee colony failure rates are multiples: diseases, parasites, pesticides and poor nutrition for instance.
