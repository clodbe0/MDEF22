# Research through Design



To generate knowledge, to combine knowledge from different disciplines, to abstract future thinking with everyday practice, to use all the skills that I could have as a designer.

**Role 1.**
The first role of prototyping has an experimental component: the prototype itself embeds what I want to test.

**Role 2.**
Prototype as a tool for inquiry: I don't know what I'm looking for, so prototyping is the way to capture infos and learn by provoking and causing reactions.

**Role 3.**
Research archetype: prototype to show possibilities and physical embodiment of concepts. It helps the designer to understand better the possibilities, it creates possibilities.

**Role 4.**
Vehicle for inquiry: it is not the prototype itself, but the process who generates knowledge. The process as a method and a way to discover, so it should be documented. Getting people involved in the process (co-design, participatory design) to explore together.


During my short experience as a designer, I got in touch with some of these roles of prototyping. I feel that the **Role 1** happened many times when we had to test out any kind of experimental trials like texture, materials or colors. Once, during my bachelor, we had to develop a game made out of recycled materials and after experimenting with a wide range of options we ended up using leftover cardboard pieces to develop a book for children, in order to create different texture.
Another example that comes to my mind is about the **Research archetype**. I worked for a couple of years in a ceramic studio and the studio itself was kind of a showroom. It was full of everyday-use ceramics and people could assembly them choosing any possible way they wanted to. This process became many times an inspiration for us, cause we saw assemblies that we just never thought about and that became new ideas for new projects.
The role of prototyping that attracts me the most, and that I had the chance to explore the most, is the **Vehicle for inquiry**. For my thesis project I decided to do a pilgrimage in the Centre of Italy on a hike called “Cammino nelle Terre Mutate”. 257 km through the villages of Centre of Italy that experienced 2009 and 2016 earthquakes, walking, observing and interacting with local people and environment, in order to find out the necessities and needs of both communities and territory, and try to satisfy them.
The whole project happened just thanks to being involved in first person in the process and to the involvement of the local people that I met on the way and their experience. By exploring together their needs and the needs of the environment, the project shaped itself.

# "A shift from designing for to co-designing with" Agger Eriksen 2012.
From this article written by Anna Servalli I found enlightening the concept of *"togetherness that becomes a core aspect of the design process as a way to foster collaboration after the design phase"*

I think that the combination between the second (a role of prototyping that I've never used so it would be self challenging to try out) and the fourth role would be interesting to understand my position and possibilities. I'm interested to understand the food waste and food gentrification phenomena better, I still don't know which way I'm going that's why I believe that see honest reactions along the way could help my development. Also, getting people involved in the project represents a very powerful way of doing design for me, and also an exercise of openness and listening processes.
