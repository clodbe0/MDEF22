# Community Engagement

Classes happened in Can Batllò, un espacio comunitario in Sants, with Markel Commen and Mercè Rua from Holon.


*"Simplifying complexity is never a good idea"*, every challenge assessed with sufficient perspective becomes a wicked one. We know how to deal with the simple and complicated but not with the complex ones.

The important of **mapping**: it's a tool to work with others, to understand our challenge, to build and share common knowledge, to take in consideration hard and soft infrastructures.
What do we map? causes and effects, involved actants, historical evolution, case studies.


**Transition Design** is a social and environmental context of design, it shapes the everyday life of transitions and seeks for long term transitions with a proper theory of change in a long term vision of impact. Within the mapping process, it helps to relate with communities and to approach a post humanist perspective.
But how to intervene in a system?

- sense and understand system dynamic

- identify pressure and leverage points

- build more desirable future visions

- crafting an intervention portfolio to plot who else is in the system

- probe, sense, respond: waiting for the system to react

- practice the back casting: starting with the future vision and go background to the present in a transition pathway


*"The value of design is in its process, not just the output"* cause the process itself has an impact. Design requires a commitment to a purpose of practice, brings whatever knowledge and capabilities to address a problem or an opportunity.
When designing community engagements the role of the **facilitator** make the process easier: we're always operating in a complex system so we need this role who provides infrastructures, process and support necessities to perform a task, but staying out it. The facilitator does not participate but creates and inclusive space to encourage full participation and effective communication. Dance and balance!
