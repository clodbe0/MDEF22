# About




Claudia (she/her)


I am passionate about everything related to people: the way we communicate with each other, the way we think, the way we speak, the way we don’t.
I think design is about finding solutions, solving problems. I believe design needs listening.
I know that I can only achieve self-accomplishment by exploiting the potential of design to be a driver of change.
So let's make a change.


I like everything that’s hand made.
I started several times crocheting but never completed a work.
Still struggling about it.

I could spend hours on the pottery wheel though. It’s my safe space.


As I stepped into MDEF, I was not sure what I would have ended up doing but since the day that I got to know Domestic Data Streamers I was sure that I would have worked with data and perception.
It’s been a long path that kept changing and evolving day by day. Every term I focused
on something different, and this sometimes made me feel very lost but it also gave me the possibility of learn different topics and discover new interests and design applications.
I’m very satysfied with the final output of the third term because it fully reflects my interests and passion.
I believe data have the power of representing all the aspects of the world, but there’s a
lack in accessibility, which make them non- democratic. That’s why I worked on a visual experience that bridges the gap between data and human perception. In the past art managed to become democratic, now is the turn of data.
In a world inundated with vast amounts
of data, the power of immersive visual experiences as a tool to read them and experience them cannot be underestimated. They have the potential to transcend mere information, creating meaningful and memorable encounters that leave a lasting impact on viewers.
I feel that I started my path in merging
the bridge between science and art, by presenting real-time data in such a visually compelling and personal way, by fostering a deeper connection between viewers and the intricacies of the subject matter.
I managed to transform abstract data into tangible visual representations. Whether projected onto a wall or displayed on screens, these visualizations have the potential to engage and captivate audiences, making complex information accessible and impactful.

Through the transcendent nature of immersive visuals, complex data is made accessible and impactful, stimulating curiosity, reflection, and connection.
It is an invitation for viewers to explore and engage with real-time data in a profound and meaningful way, transcending the boundaries of traditional information dissemination.
Engaging and captivating audiences goes beyond mere information dissemination. It has the power to inspire action and drive change. When complex information is made accessible and impactful, it has the potential to motivate individuals to think critically, challenge existing beliefs, and take action based on newfound knowledge. It can ignite conversations,
foster empathy, and spur individuals towards positive social, environmental, or personal transformation.
I believe in change.
