Claudia (she/her)


I am passionate about everything related to people: the way we communicate with each other, the way we think, the way we speak, the way we don’t.
I think design is about finding solutions, solving problems. I believe design needs listening.
I know that I can only achieve self-accomplishment by exploiting the potential of design to be a driver of change.
So let's make a change.


I like everything that’s hand made.
I started several times crocheting but never completed a work.
Still struggling about it.

I could spend hours on the pottery wheel though. It’s my safe space.
