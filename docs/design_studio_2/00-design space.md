#A new design space

At the end of the first term, I had to reflect on the evolution of my design space. This is the beginning, where I'm standing at the very start of second term. I have many inspirations, different fields that I wanna explore and people I'd love to collaborate with.

**Clay**

If I have to think what I'm passionate about I'd start with clay and pottery.
During my last year of bachelor I had to do an internship. Covid just happened and after months of online lessons I couldn't not spend one more minute in front of my laptop.
That's why I decided to knock the door of a pottery studio called Unomi, in Turin, Italy.
Cristina, the owner of the lab and an amazing artisan taught me everything, not just how to spin the wheel, but how to deal with a studio that works with students who are learning, with clients and with restaurants who want specific shapes and specific color for each plate.
I worked at **Unomi** for two years and it changed myself and my life.
When I moved to Barcelona I decided not to give up on that and brought with me my spin wheel to share my passion with others.
I think it's what I like to do the most.

When MDEF started, I decided to leave the ceramic aside for a moment, in order to give myself the opportunity to focus also on other interest that I have.
Then I met Marc, our Catalan classmate also interested in clay and more specifically in traditional techniques and local clay.
At the beginning of November we went together to La Bisbal, a small town close to Girona famous for its artisans, industries and clay. We discovered around, went to factories, small artisans shops and museums. It was inspiring to me seeing how different are the methods that are traditional over there, compared to what I consider traditional! While in Rome...

Anyways, the trip to la Bisbal made me feel the urge to explore also clay as a possible design intervention field.
Also, during the Tech Beyond the Myth week we had the chance to go visit Transfolab, which became part of the ideal process... but I'll talk about it later.

So here I am. For now, I will participate to Marc's intervention, to support and help him out when needed, while developing my own concept.

I think it's exciting and scaring at the same time to open it up as a project, but I feel like there are some needs in the ceramic field that are to be satisfied.

A problem that many ceramist artisans experience and that I experienced in the first place while working at Unomi, is the impossibility to recycle the ceramic after that it gets fired.

How does the process work?

1. give a shape to the clay
2. fire it
3. glaze it
4. fire it again

Not every single type of clay works like this, mostly just the high temperature ones, like grés for instance. Some types just need one fire, but still, once it's fired even once, the pottery cannot be brought back to clay.




**Drugs**

It’s no secret that drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, dance clubs or raves.
Quite simply, people do it because it can enhance their experience. But we’re not here to justify, give reasons or explain why people do it.  It’s a fact.
Drug use exists, and there’s the urgent need to make it happen in the most safe way possible.
We take for granted that festival organizers know that drugs will get onto the site, so we believe it's a responsibility to make sure people remain safe. Denying the issue just causes fatalities.

“Festivals attract a wide array of people not experienced with party drugs. Relying on strangers inside to purchase drugs is a risk factor for purchasing adulterated products. Fear of security/police at festivals leads to risky drug-taking such as ingesting one’s full batch of drugs at the entrance. These risks are compounded by environmental factors including crowding, hot temperature, and lack of water and inadequate medical emergency response.”

We want to help people to make informed and responsible choices, raising awareness about substances in circulation and reducing the chance of drug-related problems.

We hope for a local music policy that doesn’t deny the use of drugs but aims for harm reduction advice and support by showing how to do it safely, giving a non-judgmental service, accessible and available to all.

We are working on informational outputs, some developed as a guerrilla marketing action so to print out posters and to stick them around clubs, bars and discos. Also, connecting stickers to a survey to gather data and to a insta account. We want to create a community.
