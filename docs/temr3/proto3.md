#Prototyping for Design

**ROBOT**
Both theoretical and practical aspect about using a Robot. Completely new topic for me.

**BLENDER**
Why using Blender? This is how the class started. The point that I agree the most with is that blender is built by a community and that's why it has more potential, and also I think it has an horizontal communication and accessibility.
Also, in Blender the priority is the design, not the profit and not just the design that we create but also the possibility to shape the design of the tool itself.
Victor introduced us to Roosendaal, I knew the studio before but I didn't know about the fact that he started and released Blender.
When the propaganda was over (just kidding, it was a great ethical introduction on the software) we were introduced to the interface, the system, the properties and the personalisation (a complete new topic for me since that I'm used to Adobe...)
