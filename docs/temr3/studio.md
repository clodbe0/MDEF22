#Design Studio III

**Reflections**

The last term, which in a way felt very short because I found myself with many things to work on, was very sperimental (finally hands on!) and got me to the point of facing reality in multiples ways:
- Nothing is still, everything keeps evolving:
for the first time I worked as almost a full
time job on a project, and I was surprised by the fact that every time that we felt that we arrived somewhere, everything was changing again: us, our ideas, the project itself. Unfolding Conversations evolved day by day and us with it. Sometimes this process was frustrating because it never gave us time to rest, on the other hand it was really satisfying to face all this issues and, in a way or another, always sorting them out.
P.S. Unfolding Conversations is still work in progress!
- Working opportunities: deciding to submit the application to Sonar helped us to push
the project further and to work with a lot of effort on it, also jumping on stuff that we didn’t know before and so developing new skills; on the other hand, being rejected was a punch in the face, especially after all the effort. We were hoping to give life to Unfolding Conversations and show it to a wide public but, for now, this won’t happen. Facing this limit is challenging but also educating.

LOOKING FORWARD
Mariana and I will keep work on it. The time off in El Hierro helped us to clear off our thoughts about it and now we have more ideas that we will try to develop.
I guess that my identity changed in a way
that managed to adapt to many different challenges and opportunities, and this made even more clear who I want to be as a designer, what I want to focus on and what I seek for myself as a person and my career.
I want to keep work on social issues, related to the context that I’m living in, in order to face with a first person perspective and then explore it throughout autoethnographic research and radical situatedness.
I want to be active participant.

**Alternative Presents**
Throughout our third intervention we manage to create a collective, but personal, space for people in order to support our alternative present. The Confessional gave people the opportunity to reflect, open up and talk about drug experiences but still respecting privacy, so in a private and anonymous way.
Also the stickers around the city connected to the Google Form was a way to break a wall, increase the dialogue, have people feel comfortable with sharing personal experiences.
These processes are the first part of our strategy for creating Alternative Presents: we first gathered data, engaged with people, saw and studied reactions, to be more aware on how to move further.

Engaging with the citizens of Barcelona is still part of the next steps of our project. Since that the topic is radical, not often spoken about and might be also disturbing for some people, we decided to surf the wave and focus on two specifi ways of engagement:
- Base our actions on data: this approach can allow us to be objective and honest and drug assumption.
- Guerrilla marketing: we don’t want to hurst the sensibility of no one, so we thought that guerilla might be a good solution for us,
as it leaves to people the freedom and the decision to approach the topic, or to leave if not interested. This also automatically create an audience, and then a community, of people actually interested and that want to be involved.
