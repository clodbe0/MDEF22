#Design Ethics

- The Goods of Design. Professional ethics for designers - A book to read.
- Just Design: Past, Present and Future Trajectories of Technology by Nassim Parvin - Another book to read.


Technology is everywhere but we don't think about it. Sometimes we refuse the technology not for the technology itself but because of the ethic, the discussion behind it.
3 things about technology:

- technology is a part of our existence

- technology it is not neutral, but it doesn't determine us and doesn't define how we are

- design is a way of doing ethics (what is ethics? it is a deeper research field than a set of rules we commit to.)


If we interpret technology we could see the value of a modern society, we can spot what's important for the designers, the industry, the system, the people. Also shows what's not, what's been avoided.
From any objects, you can see the values that are imbedded.
Us and technology and interrelated

2 opposites view of technology:

- **Technological neutrality** (for instance the slogan: guns don't kill people / people kill people). This campaign wants to erase the function and the main aim of the gun production which is killing. A gun is not just any tool.
It's hard to define NEUTRALITY, because doesn't mean a result in between good or bad, but it still have an effect so it cannot really be neutral. Design is purposeful.

- **Technological determinism**: the other extreme! It's a term coined by Veblen in 1920s. The idea was very well discussed by Marx in his book "Poverty of Philosophy". This school believes that technology is the agent of social change, it moulds its behaviour and interactions.
We find different ways to relate with technology so in a way we shape it too.

Both theories forget the relation and interaction between technologies and the socio-technical networks where we use and modify them. Technology amplifies the capacity for transformation and control that we have (which is never neutral again!)

Technologies co-shape our behaviour and participates in our decision making, we need to allow it to have a dimension, since that they have a clear moral dimension. It's important the role of intermediation between humans and the world, the mediation of technology is in the perception and the actions.

Different type of mediations:

**Embodiment relation**: technology is connected to the human. A technology so close to the human that changes the way they behave. Examples: glasses, mobile phone, pen, watch. (Julio Cortazar - Paul Blackburn https://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/blackburn/blackburn_translation_cortazar_cronopios.html)

**Hermeneutic relation**: the duo is technology and the world, technology represents the world. You don't read the world but an interpretation of it, like reading the weather.

**Alterity relation**: when the technology becomes the mirror of interaction, you don't interact with the world but with the technology itself like an ATM. There's still an action to do from humans

**Background relation**: technology is there, there's no action needed. Humans don't interact neither interpret it. Like a heater.

**Cyborg relation**: similar to the embodiment but permanent, like body implants.

**Mushstability**: not neutral representation, like a fetus scan: you decode the sound and make a number out of it and it constitutes the fetus as a disabled person.

Technologies are not just one thing, are multistable. Everything is not just one thing.


**Jevon's paradox**: when technological progress or government policy increases the efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use), but the falling cost of use increases its demand, increasing, rather than reducing, resource use.
The washing machine created a new standard of cleanness.



**Areas of reflection:**

goals: what for? for whose benefit?

design: how? with whom?

usage: how?

effects: unintended, unexpected, undesired?
