#Design Ethics

The Goods of Design. Professional ethics for designers - A book to read.


Technology is everywhere but we don't think about it. Sometimes we refuse the technology not for the technology itself but because of the ethic, the discussion behind it.
3 things about technology:

- technology is a part of our existence

- technology it is not neutral, but it doesn't determine us and doesn't define how we are

- design is a way of doing ethics (what is ethics? it is a deeper research field than a set of rules that we commit to.)


If we interpret technology we could see the value of a modern society, we can spot what's important for the designers, the industry, the system, the people. Also shows what's not, what's been avoided.
From any objects, you can see the values that are imbedded.
Us and technology and interrelated

2 opposites view of technology:

- technological neutrality (for instance the slogan: guns don't kill people / people kill people). This campaign wants to erase the function and the main aim of the gun production which is killing. A gun is not just any tool.
It's hard to define NEUTRALITY, because doesn't mean a result in between good or bad, but it still have an effect so it cannot really be neutral. Design is purposeful.

- Technological determinism: the other extreme! It's a term coined by Veblen in 1920s. The idea was very well discussed by Marx in his book "Poverty of Philosophy". This school believes that technology is the agent of social change, it moulds its behaviour and interactions.
We find different ways to relate with technology so in a way we shape it too.

Both theories forget the relation and interaction between technologies and the socio-technical networks where we use and modify them. Technology amplifies the capacity for transformation and control that we have (which is never neutral again!)
