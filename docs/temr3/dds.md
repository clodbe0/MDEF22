#Distributed Design

12/04
Unfortunately I was not in class during the first day of Distributed Design, but I still went through the presentation and I got explained by my classmates the mushroom model.


13/04 Reflection tree

*Learning skills*
It was really interesting to apply to Reflection tree to my project Unfolding Conversation in order to understand and analyse its weak points. By self evaluating and giving score to my project I easily spotted fields were I could develop and grow more, like all of the environment aspect, because the project focuses more socially.


*Dynamics*
The best part of the class was listening and receiving opinions and suggestion by people that I usually don't work with. The group was very balanced and caring.


*Interactions*
I think the interactions are well connected with the dynamics, and I believe there was a good balance in both. I was on the same position as Stella, since that we share a very similar project, not the root of the project itself but how it behaves socially and environmentally, so to me was very important sharing with her but also listen to people who are stronger in points where I feel weak.

14/04 Value presentation: CURIOSITY


*Learning skills*
Our hour-long conversation about curiosity covered a very wide and different range of topics, we spaced out easily! However, we did reach a few conclusion: curiosity can be something inherent in our beings as a value that we had since we were born, that comes naturally or something that we aim for, that we seek and we work for. In both cases it can be a bridge to other values such as collaboration, inclusivity, and the power of listening.
To me the most interesting part was pointing out also all the negative aspects of curiosity and collaboration, what and where can lead to.

*Dynamics*
We started talking while writing and painting with coffee on a big paper, and I think that the combination between thoughts and art really help the flow of reflection.

*Interactions*
We managed not to interact just with our group, but during the whole class the went through different exercises that created connection between us, like the drawing exercises that I particularly enjoyed.
