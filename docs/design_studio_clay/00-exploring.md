#What is clay to me


<FONT COLOR=black>
If I have to think what I'm passionate about I'd start with clay and pottery.
During my last year of bachelor I had to do an internship. Covid just happened and after months of online lessons I couldn't not spend one more minute in front of my laptop.
That's why I decided to knock the door of a pottery studio called Unomi, in Turin, Italy. Cristina, the owner of the lab and an amazing artisan taught me everything, not just how to spin the wheel, but how to deal with a studio that works with students who are learning, with clients and with restaurants who want specific shapes and specific color for each plate.
I worked at Unomi for two years and it changed myself and my life.
When I moved to Barcelona I decided not to give up on that and brought with me my spin wheel to share my passion with others.
I think it's what I like to do the most.

I think it's exciting and scaring at the same time to open it up as a project, but I feel like there are some needs in the ceramic field that are to be satisfied.
