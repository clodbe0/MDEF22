#Communicating Ideas

**PURPOSE**

I think I believe in a state of equilibrium and harmony in which the environment, individuals and society are in proportion and alignment. This particular state is driven by inner energies, life force, vitality, education and adaptability. I believe in interconnectedness of different aspects of one's life. I believe this concept of balance and inner energies offers a holistic approach to envision a better future, acknowledging the interconnectedness of all aspects of the world considered as the interconnection between environment and people.


**VISION**

I could only achieve self - accomplishment by exploiting the potential of design to be a driver of change and education. In fact, I believe that design is able to manage complexity, and along with its creative and innovative perspective, can be a powerful tool to tackle the major challenges that our generation is facing. I’m also committed not to dedicate my life and energies to that, and to find a personal balance between personal life, world care and career.


**MISSION**

In the future I aim to:
be flexible, adaptable, be many things but also one only if I feel like. Feel free to change mindset, opinion and job as many times as I want to. Have the time to care of myself and of the people that I love. Be curious, always having the possibility to learn something new. Be good at doing something after failing many times. Having a job where I satisfy my need to change something in this world and society, even if it’s a very small one. Live by the sea.



**MINIMUM VIABLE MESSAGE**

The Unfolding Conversations project utilizes VR technology and interaction design to create a safe and inclusive space for discussing the use of psychoactive substances. Through a physical installation called "The Confessional" and a complementary VR experience, users can share their personal experiences anonymously and learn from others' stories in a controlled environment. Our aim is to foster an immersive and collaborative dialogue on this topic.
