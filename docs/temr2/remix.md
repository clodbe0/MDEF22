#Remixing Materials




**Material around me: SILVER**


I chose silver because I wear it every day on my fingers, on my ears, on my nipple and on my belly. I’m surrounded by it.
Silver has the highest known electrical and thermal conductivity of all metals. It’s shiny, it tarnishes slowly in air because the sulfur reacts with the surface creating a black silver sulfide. The more you wear silver, the less you would have to clean it to remove the sulfide. Also, it has antibacterial properties, which open up to medical uses. We can say that the main properties are electrical conductivity and decorative beauty.
The silver that is used for jewellery is called sterling silver and contains 92.5% silver, the rest is usually other metals. Silver is also used for tableware, for mirrors, batteries, electrical contacts and medical alloys. The nano parts are used in the clothing industry for touchscreen fingertips. It’s a materials that was also very important in the development of film photography because the silver bromide is sensible to light. Also, in history it was used in the manufacture of coins.
Silver was started to be mined around 3000 BC and the material was refined by heating it up in a shallow cup, so that other materials like copper would oxidate.
In Medieval, German mines were the most effective source of Silver in Europe.




**Material from reference: slime molds from Dasha Plesen**


Chose it because it makes me believe in parallel words, futures and opens up my imaginations. Bacteria and organism that create funny shades and colors in around 4 weeks. They are eukaryotic organism which create spores. They were before classified as fungi but now switched to the group of Protista. All around the world, we can classify more than 900 species of molds. They feed on bacteria, fungi and microorganism that live on dead plant that’s why they contribute to decomposition.
We can find them in soil, lawns, fruits, forest ground but also in leaf mold in rain gutters and in air conditioners. Fun facts: they are saprophytic and lack chlorophyll. They are all harmless cause non toxic and actually beneficial, especially for the soil because they return nutriment to it.
Unfortunately, sometimes they can be seen as dirty or toxic because of the smell that they produce, but it’s because the tip of the stalk is covered with slime spores that attract flies.




**Ideal Material: CHOLT**


Chose it because I wish it existed, especially these days cause it’s pretty cold in Barcelona and I have my heating system broken. The name Cholt speaks for itself: it’s the combination of hot and cold. Why? Because this material keeps a neutral temperature of 15 degrees but when it touch with very cold or hot surfaces (body, other materials and so on…) it manages to balance that out by raising or lowering its own temperature. Examples: when your feet are really cold, as soon as Cholt is in touch with them it become 30 degrees. When your face is really hot in the summer it becomes 0 degrees.
The Cholt looks like wool, it comes in yarns so that people can create the shape that feet them better. It’s very soft and resistant thanks to the conductive fibers inside.
Scientists (me, myself and I) are trying to study further application of the material to fight climate change or environmental disasters, and try to adapt the shape to a larger scale.
