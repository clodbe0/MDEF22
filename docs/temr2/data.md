#Measuring the World

Making tools for data collection that don't extract data from humans, being able to turn data into informations for humans, created by humans.
Data are supposed to be fair, tangible, honest and accessible to all.

How to collect data? How to use them after? How to play with data while building a sense of responsibility towards them?



**WE WANT A BETTER WORK LIFE BALANCE**

questions:
- Do I spend enough time in nature?
- Is my work fulfilling?
- Is my identity / life shaped mostly by my work?
- Are our salaries high enough?
- Do we get health care?
- Do we have recovery time at the end of a work day?
- Do we have time to connect with people in a meaningful way?
- Do we have time and energies to do what we love?
- Do we feel we are free to choose?


Pick one question and make a statement out of it:

Do we have time and energies to do what we love?

At the end of a working day people don't have the time and the mental / physical energy to do what they love.


There are two approaches to measure data:
1. collect data myself and use it
2. use data collected by others


Reverse auction to distribute the available tools between the groups. We need Arduino.

**Reflections**

I think that working both on data collected by yourselves and the one that we analysed throughout Orange gave us the opportunity to find many critic points in the way we organised and approached the challenge. We lacked in organisation since the beginning because we started with a very broad topic, we should have focused on something less broad and made a more specific hypothesis we would have gained better results, especially in the data collected by Arduino cause we would have had more time to dedicate in collecting data. Same thing with Orange: if you feed it with a more selected range of data, it's easier to keep the focus on what you're looking for.
