#Measuring the World

Making tools for data collection that don't extract data from humans, being able to turn data into informations for humans, created by humans.
Data are supposed to be fair, tangible, honest and accessible to all.

How to collect data? How to use them after? How to play with data while building a sense of responsibility towards them?



**WE WANT A BETTER WORK LIFE BALANCE**

questions:
- Do I spend enough time in nature?
- Is my work fulfilling?
- Is my identity / life shaped mostly by my work?
- Are our salaries high enough?
- Do we get health care?
- Do we have recovery time at the end of a work day?
- Do we have time to connect with people in a meaningful way?
- Do we have time and energies to do what we love?
- Do we feel we are free to choose?


Pick one question and make a statement out of it:

Do we have time and energies to do what we love?

At the end of a working day people don't have the time and the mental / physical energy to do what they love.
