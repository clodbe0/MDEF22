I\u2019m understanding that the process of knowing myself can generate a design action. Being in control and processing my personal development, the changes I went and I go through and my growth in connection with the environment I live in, can help me to focus on how I see design should be and define my ethic of design. I wanna put my personal identity in the context of my visions in order to be fully involved. Research through Design and Prototype \u00b6 To generate knowledge, to combine knowledge from different disciplines, to abstract future thinking with everyday practice, to use all the skills that I could have as a designer. Role 1. The first role of prototyping has an experimental component: the prototype itself embeds what I want to test. Role 2. Prototype as a tool for inquiry: I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for, so prototyping is the way to capture infos and learn by provoking and causing reactions. Role 3. Research archetype: prototype to show possibilities and physical embodiment of concepts. It helps the designer to understand better the possibilities, it creates possibilities. Role 4. Vehicle for inquiry: it is not the prototype itself, but the process who generates knowledge. The process as a method and a way to discover, so it should be documented. Getting people involved in the process (co-design, participatory design) to explore together. During my short experience as a designer, I got in touch with some of these roles of prototyping. I feel that the Role 1 happened many times when we had to test out any kind of experimental trials like texture, materials or colors. Once, during my bachelor, we had to develop a game made out of recycled materials and after experimenting with a wide range of options we ended up using leftover cardboard pieces to develop a book for children, in order to create different texture. Another example that comes to my mind is about the Research archetype . I worked for a couple of years in a ceramic studio and the studio itself was kind of a showroom. It was full of everyday-use ceramics and people could assembly them choosing any possible way they wanted to. This process became many times an inspiration for us, cause we saw assemblies that we just never thought about and that became new ideas for new projects. The role of prototyping that attracts me the most, and that I had the chance to explore the most, is the Vehicle for inquiry . For my thesis project I decided to do a pilgrimage in the Centre of Italy on a hike called \u201cCammino nelle Terre Mutate\u201d. 257 km through the villages of Centre of Italy that experienced 2009 and 2016 earthquakes, walking, observing and interacting with local people and environment, in order to find out the necessities and needs of both communities and territory, and try to satisfy them. The whole project happened just thanks to being involved in first person in the process and to the involvement of the local people that I met on the way and their experience. By exploring together their needs and the needs of the environment, the project shaped itself. \u201c A shift from designing for to co-designing with. \u201d Agger Eriksen 2012. From this article written by Anna Servalli I found enlightening the concept of \u201ctogetherness that becomes a core aspect of the design process as a way to foster collaboration after the design phase\u201d I think that the combination between the second (a role of prototyping that I\u2019ve never used so it would be self challenging to try out) and the fourth role would be interesting to understand my position and possibilities. I\u2019m interested to understand the food waste , local food accessibility and food gentrification phenomena better, and most of all the possibility to visualize Co2 emission related to food. I still don\u2019t know which way I\u2019m going that\u2019s why I believe that see honest reactions along the way could help my development. Also, getting people involved in the project represents a very powerful way of doing design for me, and also an exercise of openness and listening processes.

Are we aware of how much we throw away while we cook? No, and no. In order to understand better, we decided to put ourself in first perceptive and analyze our limits and our skills. We collected food waste (parts of vegetables that we would have thrown away while cooking, bad gone food etc\u2026) for a couple of days and on a Monday night we met. The table of my kitchen was covered in food waste. First step: analyze what we have and come up with recipes to cook INGREDIENTS old and dry bread (a lot) olive water pumpkin skin pumpkin seeds lemon cucumber peel avocado peel old carrots carrots green beetroots green old lettuce old apples mandarine peel old lemons apple peel and core carrots peel potatoes peel olives water asparagus white part agua faba (from chickpeas) old tomatoes coffe grounds sweet potatoes peel old wine old yogurt In order to realize some specific recipes, we used also flour, sugar, salt, olive oil, seed oil, philadelphia cheese, cinnamon, tahin, curcuma, pepper, almonds. RECIPES \u2022 Pumpkin skin cream : boil the pumpkin peel with salt until in gets soft, then blend it and adjust the flavor with pepper, lemon and curcuma. \u2022 Agua faba crackers : whip 100g the aqua faba and then add 100g of flour and 40g of olive oil. Bake in the oven at 180 degrees for 24 minutes. \u2022 Beetroots greens : boil the greens and blend them with tahin, olive oil, salt and pepper to make a cream. \u2022 Carrot green pesto : mix the carrot green with almonds, philadelphia and olive oil and blend! \u2022 Sweet potatoes, carrot and potatoes peels chips : mix all the peals and add any kind of spices that you feel like and oil. Side it with aquafaba and cucumber peel dip. \u2022 Apple crisp : cook down apples with sugar and cinnamon, until soft. For the crisp, make bread crumbs and combine with spices, sugar, cinnamon and butter. Bake the apples first for 20 minutes, and then after add the crisp mixture onto of apples and bake for 20 min. \u2022 Carnaval toast : Heat milk and cinnamon in a saucepan and once boiled, add sugar. You cover the bread with the milk. Let stand for 1h. Then you roll the toast with egg and fry it with plenty of oil. \u2022 Mulled wine : cook the old wine with mandarine peels, sugar, cinnamon, apple peals and cores. REVIVING RECIPIES \u2022 Stale bread, soak in water and bake it for 15-20min at 148 degrees \u2022 Lettuce: soak in cold water for 30 min Second step: hands in action, let\u2019s cook Each one of us focused on some specific recipes, we helped each other along the whole process. We were tasting and having other people testing food all the time trying to make our best in order to actually have something nice to eat. We really exchanged knowledge and skills all the way through, listening to each other and respecting each other. Honestly, it was great. It took us around two hours, we had many steps to do and just one kitchen with basic tools available. Third step: set the table, sit down, taste it out! We decided to make it nice, we felt like we deserved it. So we cleaned everything and set a nice table, even with candles! We recorded the testing moments because we wanted to remember real reactions. We didn\u2019t expect it at all but we can say that the food was good, and it was so much! We all went back home with full stomach and full tupperware with some leftovers! Fourth step: reflections We decided to reflect before and after the experience. These are mine. Claudia - Reflection from Food Waste Dinner Before What are my expectations about cooking with food waste? First of all, I hope we have enough waste to cook. I\u2019m a little scared, I don\u2019t know what are we actually gonna be able to cook because cooking in general is not easy, and making something taste good takes a little bit of practice, especially if it\u2019s food waste. Joining forces can help, I\u2019m sure, and I truly believe in the team. I hope we manage to respect the space and the tools that we have available. Why do I think of this as food waste? / why would I normally be throwing it away? - I truly believe that the food waste that we generate has a huge cultural components: we are just not used and not educated to cook some specific parts of fruits and vegetables. Another problem is capitalism: I know I\u2019m sorry to bring it up as the devil always but we are so used to have fast and demanding life so that we have very little time and we end up going groceries maybe once a week, well I think that this system generates more waist, compared to the utopian idea to be able to each day, or every other day, buy what we need to eat, consume it and not forget it in the fridge.

This causes a dispossession of culturally important foods to traditional users. Generally speaking, usually this happens when the white middle and upper classes are immersed in alternative food networks and so they impose privileged visions of food access, causing a detriment to minorities and lower income classes. In the last ten years North America and Europe have been overwhelmed by a \u201cgreen wave\u201d, that caused a big and positive change in many fields, bringing people to a new awareness and concern about sustainability. This trend of sustainability helps spreading its values, but has also many downsides (greenwashing is probably the biggest example). The \u201cgreen wave\u201d has brought many positive outcomes in the we approach to food and in the way we eat. It is more easy and common to find vegetarian and vegan options in restaurant for instance, or we are all more aware how much water and supplies do meat industries need and how they actually treat animals. But probably we\u2019re not so aware about the negative consequences of this huge and sudden change in the way we approach to food. Just to be clear, I\u2019m not against it, I just would love that everyone trusted the market a little less, because the greenwashing happens everywhere and in any possible way, and nowadays for many producers this sustainable approach is not an ethic but just a way to make money. The most common example of a trendy green food that has huge social consequences is avocado, that nowadays can be also called the \u201cgreen gold\u201d and that causes many conflicts in South America, but we keep having our avocados on toast thinking to be very healthy, green and bio (just a very small number of people know the actual meaning of \u201cbio\u201d and they use it as a label for everything). I decided to bring quinoa as a case study, after traveling around Per\u00f9 for more than a month, hiking a lot and being in deep contact with small and local communities, so after having the chance of eye-witnessing how much traditional users actually depend on quinoa. They have it almost for every meal, mostly cooked in a soup. Quinoa from being a local food, integral to indigenous people from Andes, suddenly became a burgeoning global food commodity, a statement to say \u201clook, I eat healthy and respect my body\u201d. Local users cook it very differently from the way we do in Europe, so beside the dispossession there is also traditional misreading and disrespect. The global prices for the crop are rising and becoming unaffordable for traditional users, and as in most of the industrialized processes rural communities are always the most vulnerable participants, so even if they own the food, they get least benefits from it. My personal fight is to become more aware in the way I eat, try to be more critic and analyze deeply what is sold by industries, try to go deeper and understand the world in a wider scale, not just stopping to my personal interests and comforts. I wanna be fully conscious of the social and environmental consequences of my actions. In my opinion, being more local as possible, when it is possible, is a very good way to fight extreme globalized and gentrified food. We have to learn more where food comes from, what consequences does it have, and also acquire a knowledge about what does the ground where we live can provide to us. We should count on proximity life, buy in local shops and small scale producers, also to support them.

Our mdef class became a small but very effective lab, guided by Nuria and Jordi. We had the chance to practice the theory throughout five experiments: 1. In a sterile environment we prepared a media for microorganism to grow in, and then we actually collected the microorganism (our imagination went to the point of collecting blood\u2026) 2. We cooked bioplastics ! Agar agar as a carbon chain, glycerol as the alcohol group and hydrogen + the aesthetic addition of apple peel to make our mold nicer 3. Look closer: with the microscopy we had the chance to really look deep in details. (The devil really is in the details huh!). 4.

And about Kombucha, it is growing on me that much that I will start my small production at home! The picture that I chose represents my favorite experiment: that day we were making bio plastic (which are not the solution okay?) but after some hours of listening the theory, using our hands, brains and recipes to actually cook some felt incredible. Honey bees get stressed \u00b6 Why honey bees get stressed? And what are the consequences? Stress : noun // A state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or demanding circumstance. // Great worry caused by a difficult situation, or something that causes this condition. // Physiological concept that allows organisms to respond to adverse environmental pressures. And yes, not just humans and other mammals can feel stressed, but also honey bees. The articles that I want to discuss claims that Bees get stressed at work too and it might be causing colony collapse , (published in June 2018 by The Conversation). That animals feel emotions and moods we can take for granted: emotions is not just an internal awareness of a feeling, but also a physical and behavior change. The emotional life of animals, insects and specifically bees has been studied for a long time, and it showed impressive results: bees don\u2019t experience human-like emotions, but it feels like something to be an insect. Some recent studies by Geraldine Wright at Newcastle University in the UK have showed that honeybees may experience something akin to moods. They proved that bees show a state of negative affect triggered by agitation, \u201cassociated with system-wide changes in neurotransmitters and causes clear, measurable cognitive biases\u201d . But what does cause stress to honey bees? Stress in bees has been studied throughout the reaction of multiple aspects as behavioral, physiological or cellular stress responses. And, as it happens to human, stressors affect the immune system, causing ripple effect. Here are some causes of stress in honey bees. The shape of the hive can be a cause: Open Source Beehives designed a hive that encourages happiness for health bees, by reducing the stress. The shape of common hives aim to maximize the honey production. This one instead allow bees to build their combs in more natural curving shapes. Also, when a parasite infect the hive, they produce a warning pheromone to communicate the danger to each other, and this pheromone itself cause a social stress. But if the threat is bigger than a parasite, let\u2019s say a big animal, or a human, the bees are gonna produce a bigger quantity of pheromone. Yes, bees are social insects and as most of them they use pheromone to communicate! Insects have been using pheromones for communications throughout evolutionary history. Chemical communication help insects to be organized inside the colonies. \u201cIf the social harmony gets disrupted, it can cause colony collapse, meaning complete dysfunction of the hive.\u201d Christopher Mayack says. What is this pheromone? Bees release it when they sting, when they\u2019re killed, to take care of other individuals, but they use it also to mark flowers after they removed the nectar. It is basically a call to action used for collective decision making and rapid communication in the community. And it can work in a repelling or attracting way. Another cause of stress is the intense foraging . Honey bees develop and change many jobs during their working like: they start brood nursing, cleaning and food storing, then they might get a promotion to be a guardian of the hive entrance against intruders and predators. But the major event is when they have to work in foraging for food sources. This big jump to foraging corresponds to hormonal and physiology changes, and that\u2019s because foraging requires a lot: it is the activity that exposes bees to most stressful situation, that requires the biggest amount of energies and exposes the insect to new environments. \u201dOctopamine is two to four times more abundant in brains of forager than those of nurse bees\u201d . Octopamine is a neurotransmitter that basically works as prompter of dynamic actions to the organism and help honey bees to deal with the stress of foraging. And what are the consequences of stressed honey bees? Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is the answer. This syndrome has been affecting honey bees increasingly over the past 15 years and is \u201cthe result of an accumulation of stressors chronically weakening honey bee colonies\u201d . This phenomenon happen when the working bees disappear and leave the queen and some nurse bees alone in the hive. The Colony Collapse Disorder in a very complex syndrome with many causes, but stress is one of them. The stressors that are causing an increase in honey bee colony failure rates are multiples: diseases, parasites, pesticides and poor nutrition for instance. But we don\u2019t have just direct threats that are causing this issue, but also the so called \u201csublethal stressors\u201d which don\u2019t directly kill bees, but harm them or make them change behavior. In other words: fumes and pesticides disturb chemical communication in honey bees\u2019s brains. This means just one thing: empty hives. Other reasons are related to the CCD as poor nutrition, pathogens, parasites and pests and many actions are being taken into consideration in order to protect honey bees and pollinators (wild bees too are in danger and very important for the environment.) The best thing that the public can take is not to use pesticides randomly and help them out by planting pollinator friendly plants as foxglove, bee balm, red clover and other plants! P.S.

The first person perceptive is a way of acting, of looking at things, of being involved. It is a way to act and react. It has challenges, scales and rules in order to understand myself in context: my boundaries, my limits and my possibilities. In order to be more in tune. My Companion During today\u2019s class Kristina Anderson gave us the task to build in 10 minutes a companion with wasted material that we brought from home. This companion is supposed to satisfy a desire: CURIOSITY, the need to gain knowledge. I built Nadir. Here she is. Nadir and I are gonna live together pretty easily. I will wear her when I\u2019m awake and active, and when I\u2019m not she still will be, producing light, and will stay next to my bed. She\u2019s my companion and her aim in life is to bring curiosity and help me out to gain knowledge. Basically she\u2019s a boredom clock for me: until her light runs, I will try to achieve the most I can from my everyday life, she\u2019s there to remind me not to procrastinate, to explore, to experience also when I feel that I\u2019m stuck in my routine. Also, I will constantly have to check if her light is still on so I will always have an eye on her. That\u2019s our pact: I\u2019ll take care of her and in exchange she will be a life curiosity reminder for me. When I build her, her light guided me: I started without a specific idea and then I ended up building an altar for her and also making her wearable for me, in order to be in touch and actual contact with her. She matters for me because I noticed that since I moved to Barcelona I\u2019m experiencing newness a lot, and I don\u2019t wanna stop, so to me it\u2019s meaningful to give a shape to this idea and willing. After 41 hours Nadir still works, her light is still on. This really surprised me cause due to her old age I thought she would have not survived more than 24 hours. But here she still is, and hopefully she\u2019ll survive even longer. She fulfilled her main function: any time that I looked at her she was helping to actually using up the spare time that I\u2019ve had available in the last days and I actually didn\u2019t procrastinate in any of the things that I wanted to do. Spending time with her during the night and during the time that I was home alone (my flatmate is not in Barcelona right now) made me realize another important meaning that she has for me. I truly felt her as a companion: I felt more comfortable walking around Barcelona in the dark and less lonely while I was home alone Tuesday night. She started by being just an object with a specific function, so it was very surprising to discover that she is way more than that (and also she\u2019s something more than I designer her to be). I feel that I\u2019m surrounded by objects all the time, but they just mean their function to me. Nadir managed to be more than her function. She truly helped with time and boredom management, she motivated me and kept me company. I was a bit skeptical about her actual meaning in my life but it worked out well. 24 HOURS How can I take action on my concept in a brave way? How can I immerse myself into the topic of wasted food? I should feel an experience. I should live the topic from the inside and explore it in a first person perceptive. The food waste problem has many facets and can be faced up to in different ways. My brain started running ideas of how I could get more involved in the problem but eventually I ended up with a decision and that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do: My area of acting is Raval, the neighborhood where I live. I noticed that in Raval, being neighboring La Rambla has many food accesses and options. Not just restaurants and food chains for tourists but also groceries for local people. For 24 hours I will just eat food that\u2019s supposed to be thrown away by groceries, bakeries, bars\u2026 I will go around and just ask if they have some food (any kind) that they would toss at the end of the day. How did it go? See the video here What they offered me: Especially in fruterias they offered me way more food that I needed, but I knew I could not eat it all so I picked a little. For instance they offered me two huge boxes of zucchini, a whole box full of tomatoes and carrots. Also, they told me to come back the morning after to collect more. Some places like bars and caf\u00e8 told me that they do Too Good To Go (which is a great way to save wasted food) and so I made the decision not to get food from them. I decided also to avoid big chains like supermarkets of caf\u00e8 because they couldn\u2019t give me any explanation on where the wasted food would go (that\u2019s because the people I talked to were employees and not responsible for the shop). I focused more on local groceries so that I could get in touch directly to owners. What I collected: One pain au chocolat, two boccadillos with jamon, three zucchini, seven bananas, one pear, eight carrots, one croissant with ham and cheese. What I ate: breakfast: pan au chocolat lunch: croissant with ham and cheese, zucchini and banana snack: a pear, and I baked a banana bread dinner: zucchini and boccadillo with jamon I managed to eat more than enough, very healthy and very good too. Didn\u2019t expect it at all. Some reflection I think that when you start to involve yourself in the process you actually understand the process better. Most of all, you understand most of its potentials and limits and all of the strings attached. You actually live in first person an experience and you free yourself to the initial plan idea, in order to be more open to any kind of change, because the process itself is bringing you to that. Using myself as a tool allowed be to build memories, feelings and stronger opinions about the topic that I want to explore, it allowed me to be an \u201cinside player\u201d instead of an \u201coutsider planner\u201d. It opened myself up to different paths and gave me many more inspirations. I understood that anytime that I feel stuck I just have to go and do , to listen and to be . There\u2019s no other way to design for people.","title":"Living With My Own Ideas"},{"location":"temr1/03-Ideas/#living-with-my-own-ideas","text":"During this week we keep experiment the FIRST PERSON PERCEPTIVE as a way to involve ourselves, our bodies, to create an intimate connection with the contest.

What I collected: One pain au chocolat, two boccadillos with jamon, three zucchini, seven bananas, one pear, eight carrots, one croissant with ham and cheese. What I ate: breakfast: pan au chocolat lunch: croissant with ham and cheese, zucchini and banana snack: a pear, and I baked a banana bread dinner: zucchini and boccadillo with jamon I managed to eat more than enough, very healthy and very good too. Didn\u2019t expect it at all. Some reflection I think that when you start to involve yourself in the process you actually understand the process better. Most of all, you understand most of its potentials and limits and all of the strings attached. You actually live in first person an experience and you free yourself to the initial plan idea, in order to be more open to any kind of change, because the process itself is bringing you to that. Using myself as a tool allowed be to build memories, feelings and stronger opinions about the topic that I want to explore, it allowed me to be an \u201cinside player\u201d instead of an \u201coutsider planner\u201d. It opened myself up to different paths and gave me many more inspirations. I understood that anytime that I feel stuck I just have to go and do , to listen and to be . There\u2019s no other way to design for people.","title":"Living With My Own Ideas"},{"location":"temr1/04-Tech/","text":"Tech Beyond The Myth \u00b6 ssss Ghost Sensing Machine","title":"Tech Beyond The Myth"},{"location":"temr1/04-Tech/#tech-beyond-the-myth","text":"ssss Ghost Sensing Machine","title":"Tech Beyond The Myth"}]}
