(shorturl.at/fxN89) 1) water knowledge has a positive and significant influence on water attitude; 2) water attitude has a positive and significant impact on water behaviour; 3) water behaviour has a positive and significant impact on water literacy Clay \u00b6 If I have to think what I\u2019m passionate about I\u2019d start with clay and pottery. During my last year of bachelor I had to do an internship. Covid just happened and after months of online lessons I couldn\u2019t not spend one more minute in front of my laptop. That\u2019s why I decided to knock the door of a pottery studio called Unomi, in Turin, Italy. Cristina, the owner of the lab and an amazing artisan taught me everything, not just how to spin the wheel, but how to deal with a studio that works with students who are learning, with clients and with restaurants who want specific shapes and specific colour for each plate. I worked at Unomi for two years and it changed myself and my life. When I moved to Barcelona I decided not to give up on that and brought with me my spin wheel to share my passion with others. I think it\u2019s what I like to do the most. When MDEF started, I decided to leave the ceramic aside for a moment, in order to give myself the opportunity to focus also on other interest that I have. Then I met Marc, our Catalan classmate also interested in clay and more specifically in traditional techniques and local clay. At the beginning of November we went together to La Bisbal, a small town close to Girona famous for its artisans, industries and clay. We discovered around, went to factories, small artisans shops and museums. It was inspiring to me seeing how different are the methods that are traditional over there, compared to what I consider traditional! While in Rome\u2026 Anyways, the trip to la Bisbal made me feel the urge to explore also clay as a possible design intervention field. Also, during the Tech Beyond the Myth week we had the chance to go visit Transfolab, which became part of the ideal process\u2026 but I\u2019ll talk about it later. So here I am. For now, I will participate to Marc\u2019s intervention, to support and help him out when needed, while developing my own concept. I think it\u2019s exciting and scaring at the same time to open it up as a project, but I feel like there are some needs in the ceramic field that are to be satisfied. A problem that many ceramist artisans experience and that I experienced in the first place while working at Unomi, is the impossibility to recycle the ceramic after that it gets fired. How does the process work? give a shape to the clay fire it glaze it fire it again Not every single type of clay works like this, mostly just the high temperature ones, like gr\u00e9s for instance. Some types just need one fire, but still, once it\u2019s fired even once, the pottery cannot be brought back to clay. Drugs \u00b6 It\u2019s no secret that drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, dance clubs or raves. Quite simply, people do it because it can enhance their experience. But we\u2019re not here to justify, give reasons or explain why people do it. It\u2019s a fact. Drug use exists, and there\u2019s the urgent need to make it happen in the most safe way possible. We take for granted that festival organisers know that drugs will get onto the site, so we believe it\u2019s a responsibility to make sure people remain safe. Denying the issue just causes fatalities. \u201cFestivals attract a wide array of people not experienced with party drugs. Relying on strangers inside to purchase drugs is a risk factor for purchasing adulterated products. Fear of security/police at festivals leads to risky drug-taking such as ingesting one\u2019s full batch of drugs at the entrance. These risks are compounded by environmental factors including crowding, hot temperature, and lack of water and inadequate medical emergency response.\u201d We want to help people to make informed and responsible choices, raising awareness about substances in circulation and reducing the chance of drug-related problems. We hope for a local music policy that doesn\u2019t deny the use of drugs but aims for harm reduction advice and support by showing how to do it safely, giving a non-judgmental service, accessible and available to all. We are working on informational outputs, some developed as a guerrilla marketing action so to print out posters and to stick them around clubs, bars and discos. Also, connecting stickers to a survey to gather data and to a insta account. We want to create a community. Mari and I are working on this project together and decided to submit a project for a Sonar open call that gives space to the development of AR/VR design projects!!! Due to feb 26 th . REDUCE THE HARMS If you use, better to: Be street smart Test the drug Be informed about the correct amount of quantity related to your gender and weight Limit the number of drug per session Limit the quantity Limit how often you do it Stay hydrated Tell at least one person that you\u2019re taking drugs Be in a safe environment, surrounded by people you trust Don\u2019t be afraid to get medical help if you need it Developments I\u2019m mainly focusing on the project DRUGS? YOU BETTER KNOW Using AR, VR, and interaction design our project aims to generate a non judgmental and open minded environment to dialogue and get information about drug consumption in an informal, immersive, inclusive and interactive way. It\u2019s no secret that drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, dance clubs or raves. we don\u2019t want to justify, give reasons or explain why people do it, we just take it as a fact. There are a number of different reasons why people choose to partake in altered mind states when attending such events. Our goal here is to increase the pragmatic conversation pertaining to the recreational use of drugs through interaction design, developing interactive tools to inform as well as gather data on how much do people really know about drugs. In a nutshell, We want to help people to make informed and responsible decisions, implement a dialogue and conversation about the topic, raise awareness about substances in circulation and reduce the chance of drug-related problems by offering an immersive, visual and fun experience throughout AR, VR and interaction design accessible to all, also to people who do not use drugs. The infofree warehouse VR immersive experience. Here you are, you enter a warehouse dancing it out. The environment is a bit dark and there\u2019s people around you. You spot some icons that stand out in the crowd and driven by curiosity, you decide to touch them. Our VR immersive experience seeks to simulate what happens in our minds, literally, when consuming drugs at recreational spaces. The user is then placed into a warehouse club environment, with figures dancing. Mixed within the dances, you can see brightly coloured interactive icons. These icons represent different drugs made available in the surroundings. Once you approach the icon, a trump card is pulled, with the name and information for the selected icon. Once you are informed, you are then able to select if you want to consume the substance, or not. If you choose, not to, you will remain in the current environment. If you do chose to take the substance, you are then moved into a different environment representing your \u201ctrip\u201d. While we think the concept of cyberdelics is very interesting, we also understand that the stigma for taking drugs is not entirely audio-visual. Thus, rather than imitating a trip, we decided to make the environment inspired by the biological effect of the drug. \u201cThe binding of drugs with proteins in the blood stream is an important process in determining the eventual activity and fate of such drugs once they have entered the circulation.\u201d For our environments, we then developed models for the determined proteins that encapsulate each individual drug. The idea is that people also become informed of how the drug interacts with our bodies literally, judgement-fee. The initial catalysis. The conversation wall Interaction design and AR. The lack of communication and dialogue about drugs brings a huge lack of awareness and information in the topic itself. Also, sharing personal experiences can prevent harm to other people. We wanna help people to communicate their opinion and experiences about drugs in a way that can allow them to feel comfortable in sharing personal opinions and experiences. We designed an interactive board, which has printed 23 statements about substance use or non-use and 9 icons. Under each sentence and icon there\u2019s a long pin. At the beginning of the board there\u2019s a simple question: \u201cDo you do drugs?\u201d and the journey begins by answering this question by choosing magenta loops as a \u201cyes I do\u201d and blue as a \u201cno I don\u2019t\u201d. Users can put as many loops as they want. To allow people to feel more comfortable with their own answers we came up with the idea of the invisible answers. The icons, when scanned, show more deep and intimate statements. Using an augmented reality development package and ARKit, we developed an app which allows users to individually scan each icon, and in return, the app displays the \u201cinvisible answers\u201d on the user\u2019s phone. This is to allow people to feel more comfortable and less judged in sharing. The app however, is limited to individual deployment, thus we have to deploy it on each IOS device by building it through XCode. Having said that, the code is currently limited to IOS builds. Depending on the environment that will be available, we will adapt the board: phrases and icons can be either printed on a plywood panel or printed as stickers and attached directly to the wall. Depending on these options, we will understand the resistance of the installation and decide what material to make the magenta and blue loops of. Can be 3D printed in plastic or made out of fabric.","title":"A new design space"},{"location":"design_studio_2/00-design%20space/#a-new-design-space","text":"At the end of the first term, I had to reflect on the evolution of my design space.

Using an augmented reality development package and ARKit, we developed an app which allows users to individually scan each icon, and in return, the app displays the \u201cinvisible answers\u201d on the user\u2019s phone. This is to allow people to feel more comfortable and less judged in sharing. The app however, is limited to individual deployment, thus we have to deploy it on each IOS device by building it through XCode. Having said that, the code is currently limited to IOS builds. Depending on the environment that will be available, we will adapt the board: phrases and icons can be either printed on a plywood panel or printed as stickers and attached directly to the wall. Depending on these options, we will understand the resistance of the installation and decide what material to make the magenta and blue loops of. Can be 3D printed in plastic or made out of fabric. Developments The project is changing and evolving each week. Now it even changed name and became BEYOND DRUGS . Beyond Drugs offers a captivating virtual reality experience that intersects multiple concepts, such as protein unfolding and Huxley\u2019s Doors of Perception, to shed light on the often taboo conversations surrounding recreational drug use. The project aims to provide an inclusive and immersive experience to bring attention to the hidden dialogue around drug use. Drug consumption at music festivals, dance clubs, and raves is a well-known fact, and the project does not intend to justify it. Instead, Beyond Drugs focuses on creating a non-judgmental and open-minded environment that encourages pragmatic conversation around recreational drug use. To achieve this, the project uses interactive design and tools to gather data and inform users of personal experiences related to drug use. Increased dialogue can help reduce stigma and discrimination and acknowledging drug use can help mitigate harm. Beyond Drugs believes that promoting a more accepting and open attitude towards drug use can make a significant difference. The project is a continuous series of interactive experiences that coexist to enlighten a non-biased dialogue referring to recreational substances. What we would like to present for this Open Call is a virtual reality environment which serves as the complementary piece to a previously performed interactive installation: \u201cthe confessionary\u201d. Final exhibition presented in virtual reality is then a piece compiled from audio data previously gathered through the confessionary, working as follows: confessionary: audio recording audio2face conversation: NVIDIA Omniverse AI used to animate face models with pre recorded audio VR experience: animated anonymous faces tell individual and personal stories The lack of communication and dialogue around drugs often leads to a lack of awareness and information about the topic. At Beyond Drugs, we believe that sharing personal experiences can be a valuable tool in preventing harm to other users. To promote communication and comfortability, we have created The Confessionary - a personal, protected space where users can freely narrate their personal experiences with drugs anonymously. The Confessional is made of plywood, lightweight, and easy to carry around. All the stories shared in The Confessional are then translated into our VR experience. We recognize that the use of substances is both literary and personal, where one\u2019s experience is only superficially narrated by literature on a substance and its effects. Therefore, we believe that personal conversations are essential when discussing the topic of drugs. When someone wants to try a new recreational substance, one of the first things they often seek is information on the effects and experiences of others. This information is usually found online or from friends. However, we want to provide a safe space for people to share their experiences and create a database of stories which will be exhibited in following installations. We believe in the power of storytelling. Through the power of personal narratives, we hope to promote understanding, reduce stigma and discrimination, and create a more accepting and open attitude towards drug use. A space to share. VR immersive experience. As users enter the virtual reality space, they are presented with a room filled with many doors. Each door represents the entrance to a different recreational drug, offering users a range of choices. Upon entering a particular door, users are transported to a room filled with faces that speak about their experiences with the drug. These conversations allow users to explore the positive and negative effects of the drug from the perspective of those who have tried it. But Beyond Drugs goes beyond mere dialogue. The room also includes the protein structures that receive the drug in our bodies. Users can see the unfolding of these proteins and gain an understanding of how the drug interacts with their body at a molecular level. This experience provides a deeper understanding of the effects of the drug on the body and mind. The concept of Huxley\u2019s Doors of Perception is also at play in Beyond Drugs. By presenting users with the opportunity to experience different recreational drugs in a safe and controlled virtual environment, the project challenges their preconceived notions of reality and expands their understanding of the world around them. Users are forced to confront the consequences of their actions and explore the consequences of their choices. In conclusion, Beyond Drugs is a thought-provoking project that combines multiple concepts to bring to shore the hidden conversations around recreational drugs. By using virtual reality to present users with a safe and controlled environment to explore the effects of different drugs, the project challenges their preconceptions and expands their understanding of the world around them. Through the immersive experience, users gain a deeper appreciation of the unfolding of proteins, the Doors of Perception, and the impact of their choices on their mind and body.","title":"BEYOND DRUGS"},{"location":"design_studio_2/01-drugs/#drugs","text":"It\u2019s no secret that drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, dance clubs or raves. Quite simply, people do it because it can enhance their experience. But we\u2019re not here to justify, give reasons or explain why people do it. It\u2019s a fact. Drug use exists, and there\u2019s the urgent need to make it happen in the most safe way possible. We take for granted that festival organisers know that drugs will get onto the site, so we believe it\u2019s a responsibility to make sure people remain safe. Denying the issue just causes fatalities. \u201cFestivals attract a wide array of people not experienced with party drugs. Relying on strangers inside to purchase drugs is a risk factor for purchasing adulterated products. Fear of security/police at festivals leads to risky drug-taking such as ingesting one\u2019s full batch of drugs at the entrance. These risks are compounded by environmental factors including crowding, hot temperature, and lack of water and inadequate medical emergency response.\u201d We want to help people to make informed and responsible choices, raising awareness about substances in circulation and reducing the chance of drug-related problems. We hope for a local music policy that doesn\u2019t deny the use of drugs but aims for harm reduction advice and support by showing how to do it safely, giving a non-judgmental service, accessible and available to all. We are working on informational outputs, some developed as a guerrilla marketing action so to print out posters and to stick them around clubs, bars and discos. Also, connecting stickers to a survey to gather data and to a insta account. We want to create a community. Mari and I are working on this project together and decided to submit a project for a Sonar open call that gives space to the development of AR/VR design projects!!! Due to feb 26 th . REDUCE THE HARMS If you use, better to: Be street smart Test the drug Be informed about the correct amount of quantity related to your gender and weight Limit the number of drug per session Limit the quantity Limit how often you do it Stay hydrated Tell at least one person that you\u2019re taking drugs Be in a safe environment, surrounded by people you trust Don\u2019t be afraid to get medical help if you need it Developments I\u2019m mainly focusing on the project DRUGS? YOU BETTER KNOW Using AR, VR, and interaction design our project aims to generate a non judgmental and open minded environment to dialogue and get information about drug consumption in an informal, immersive, inclusive and interactive way. It\u2019s no secret that drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, dance clubs or raves. we don\u2019t want to justify, give reasons or explain why people do it, we just take it as a fact. There are a number of different reasons why people choose to partake in altered mind states when attending such events. Our goal here is to increase the pragmatic conversation pertaining to the recreational use of drugs through interaction design, developing interactive tools to inform as well as gather data on how much do people really know about drugs. In a nutshell, We want to help people to make informed and responsible decisions, implement a dialogue and conversation about the topic, raise awareness about substances in circulation and reduce the chance of drug-related problems by offering an immersive, visual and fun experience throughout AR, VR and interaction design accessible to all, also to people who do not use drugs. The infofree warehouse VR immersive experience. Here you are, you enter a warehouse dancing it out. The environment is a bit dark and there\u2019s people around you. You spot some icons that stand out in the crowd and driven by curiosity, you decide to touch them. Our VR immersive experience seeks to simulate what happens in our minds, literally, when consuming drugs at recreational spaces. The user is then placed into a warehouse club environment, with figures dancing. Mixed within the dances, you can see brightly coloured interactive icons. These icons represent different drugs made available in the surroundings. Once you approach the icon, a trump card is pulled, with the name and information for the selected icon. Once you are informed, you are then able to select if you want to consume the substance, or not. If you choose, not to, you will remain in the current environment. If you do chose to take the substance, you are then moved into a different environment representing your \u201ctrip\u201d. While we think the concept of cyberdelics is very interesting, we also understand that the stigma for taking drugs is not entirely audio-visual. Thus, rather than imitating a trip, we decided to make the environment inspired by the biological effect of the drug. \u201cThe binding of drugs with proteins in the blood stream is an important process in determining the eventual activity and fate of such drugs once they have entered the circulation.\u201d For our environments, we then developed models for the determined proteins that encapsulate each individual drug. The idea is that people also become informed of how the drug interacts with our bodies literally, judgement-fee. The initial catalysis. The conversation wall Interaction design and AR. The lack of communication and dialogue about drugs brings a huge lack of awareness and information in the topic itself. Also, sharing personal experiences can prevent harm to other people. We wanna help people to communicate their opinion and experiences about drugs in a way that can allow them to feel comfortable in sharing personal opinions and experiences. We designed an interactive board, which has printed 23 statements about substance use or non-use and 9 icons. Under each sentence and icon there\u2019s a long pin. At the beginning of the board there\u2019s a simple question: \u201cDo you do drugs?\u201d and the journey begins by answering this question by choosing magenta loops as a \u201cyes I do\u201d and blue as a \u201cno I don\u2019t\u201d. Users can put as many loops as they want. To allow people to feel more comfortable with their own answers we came up with the idea of the invisible answers. The icons, when scanned, show more deep and intimate statements. Using an augmented reality development package and ARKit, we developed an app which allows users to individually scan each icon, and in return, the app displays the \u201cinvisible answers\u201d on the user\u2019s phone.

I\u2019m understanding that the process of knowing myself can generate a design action. Being in control and processing my personal development, the changes I went and I go through and my growth in connection with the environment I live in, can help me to focus on how I see design should be and define my ethic of design. I wanna put my personal identity in the context of my visions in order to be fully involved. Research through Design and Prototype \u00b6 To generate knowledge, to combine knowledge from different disciplines, to abstract future thinking with everyday practice, to use all the skills that I could have as a designer. Role 1. The first role of prototyping has an experimental component: the prototype itself embeds what I want to test. Role 2. Prototype as a tool for inquiry: I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for, so prototyping is the way to capture infos and learn by provoking and causing reactions. Role 3. Research archetype: prototype to show possibilities and physical embodiment of concepts. It helps the designer to understand better the possibilities, it creates possibilities. Role 4. Vehicle for inquiry: it is not the prototype itself, but the process who generates knowledge. The process as a method and a way to discover, so it should be documented. Getting people involved in the process (co-design, participatory design) to explore together. During my short experience as a designer, I got in touch with some of these roles of prototyping. I feel that the Role 1 happened many times when we had to test out any kind of experimental trials like texture, materials or colors. Once, during my bachelor, we had to develop a game made out of recycled materials and after experimenting with a wide range of options we ended up using leftover cardboard pieces to develop a book for children, in order to create different texture. Another example that comes to my mind is about the Research archetype . I worked for a couple of years in a ceramic studio and the studio itself was kind of a showroom. It was full of everyday-use ceramics and people could assembly them choosing any possible way they wanted to. This process became many times an inspiration for us, cause we saw assemblies that we just never thought about and that became new ideas for new projects.

How does Co2 look like? I wanna involve myself in the first place. In the following days I\u2019m gonna do 4 experiments.

I\u2019ve been using digital tools in the past with the aim to create strong communities and to reach most people possible. But since I live in Barcelona, I\u2019ve had the chance to explore another form of strong sense of community life, which is the one that each neighborhood builds sharing local places and doing social activities together. I\u2019m more willing to be physically in touch with people, because I would like to use all of my senses and also I want people to experience a design intervention with all of the five senses.

Are we aware of how much we throw away while we cook? No, and no. In order to understand better, we decided to put ourself in first perceptive and analyze our limits and our skills. We collected food waste (parts of vegetables that we would have thrown away while cooking, bad gone food etc\u2026) for a couple of days and on a Monday night we met. The table of my kitchen was covered in food waste. First step: analyze what we have and come up with recipes to cook INGREDIENTS old and dry bread (a lot) olive water pumpkin skin pumpkin seeds lemon cucumber peel avocado peel old carrots carrots green beetroots green old lettuce old apples mandarine peel old lemons apple peel and core carrots peel potatoes peel olives water asparagus white part agua faba (from chickpeas) old tomatoes coffe grounds sweet potatoes peel old wine old yogurt In order to realize some specific recipes, we used also flour, sugar, salt, olive oil, seed oil, philadelphia cheese, cinnamon, tahin, curcuma, pepper, almonds. RECIPES \u2022 Pumpkin skin cream : boil the pumpkin peel with salt until in gets soft, then blend it and adjust the flavor with pepper, lemon and curcuma. \u2022 Agua faba crackers : whip 100g the aqua faba and then add 100g of flour and 40g of olive oil.

Side it with aquafaba and cucumber peel dip. \u2022 Apple crisp : cook down apples with sugar and cinnamon, until soft. For the crisp, make bread crumbs and combine with spices, sugar, cinnamon and butter. Bake the apples first for 20 minutes, and then after add the crisp mixture onto of apples and bake for 20 min. \u2022 Carnaval toast : Heat milk and cinnamon in a saucepan and once boiled, add sugar. You cover the bread with the milk. Let stand for 1h.

We were tasting and having other people testing food all the time trying to make our best in order to actually have something nice to eat. We really exchanged knowledge and skills all the way through, listening to each other and respecting each other. Honestly, it was great. It took us around two hours, we had many steps to do and just one kitchen with basic tools available. Third step: set the table, sit down, taste it out! We decided to make it nice, we felt like we deserved it. So we cleaned everything and set a nice table, even with candles! We recorded the testing moments because we wanted to remember real reactions. We didn\u2019t expect it at all but we can say that the food was good, and it was so much! We all went back home with full stomach and full tupperware with some leftovers! Fourth step: reflections We decided to reflect before and after the experience. These are mine. Reflection from Food Waste Dinner Before What are my expectations about cooking with food waste? First of all, I hope we have enough waste to cook. I\u2019m a little scared, I don\u2019t know what are we actually gonna be able to cook because cooking in general is not easy, and making something taste good takes a little bit of practice, especially if it\u2019s food waste. Joining forces can help, I\u2019m sure, and I truly believe in the team. I hope we manage to respect the space and the tools that we have available. Why do I think of this as food waste? / why would I normally be throwing it away? - I truly believe that the food waste that we generate has a huge cultural components: we are just not used and not educated to cook some specific parts of fruits and vegetables. Another problem is capitalism: I know I\u2019m sorry to bring it up as the devil always but we are so used to have fast and demanding life so that we have very little time and we end up going groceries maybe once a week, well I think that this system generates more waist, compared to the utopian idea to be able to each day, or every other day, buy what we need to eat, consume it and not forget it in the fridge. After How was the experience? What surprised you? What surprised me the most was the amount of food waste that we collected, and the fact that after cooking we reduced it just to a small bag of waste. From a table, to a bag. I really enjoyed the flow of ideas in the cooking process, and the support that we gave each other while cooking. Also, I learned new recipes from other people. Which is great. We shared a beautiful evening and dinner, It was nice to make new connection with people that I don\u2019t spend that much of a time with in class. Conclusions Food tasted better than it looked before and made a colorful meal. The produce was perfectly fine to still consume. Able to make a good amount of food with the waste food. Waste food led to creative cooking and a more immersive experience. Cooking with food waste is friendly on the pocket. Total amount of waste generated was reduced. Learned new ways to use all parts of vegetables. Cooking and eating together are great ways to bring up complicated topics. The topic \u00b6 How the waste stream started? It first happened in society when the progress of agriculture and farming gave the possibilities to developing countries to overcome the issue of limited food availability. This technology progress summed up with the increase of the average income of society allowed a bigger part of the population to access to bigger quantities of food. Food was more available, and it slowly started to cost less. This process caused a huge damage in people\u2019s perception of food value. When things become more available and cheaper, we automatically start thinking that they value less. After the Second World War, the city started being overcrowded and requiring more necessities. Transportation and infrastructures solved the problem of the distance between production site and consumption. Food waste started with globalization, technology and retail distribution. Some questions What do we want people to perceive? Do we wanna work on / change perception of value? Using the senses to intensify understanding / experience What is waste? waste noun (UNWANTED MATTER): unwanted matter or material of any type, especially what is left after useful substances or parts have been removed waste noun (BAD USE): an unnecessary or wrong use of money, substances, time, energy, abilities, etc.: waste verb [T] (USE BADLY): to use too much of something or use something badly when there is a limited amount of it \u2018Waste are unwanted or unusable materials. Waste is any substance which is discarded,after primary use, or is worthless, defective and of no use. A by-product by contrast is a joint product of relatively minor economic value. Intervention development \u00b6 The first person perceptive and the waste cooking experiments kept growing on me, reason why I decided to explore more about food waste in Raval. I found out about FoodNotBombsBCN , a collective that operates in Raval, Barcelona. Every Monday they pick up vegetables and food at Veritas, a bio supermarket in El Born, that would otherwise be thrown away. The other days other NGOs pick up the food waste. There were 5 people volunteering for FnB when we were there, they go to Agora Communal Garden and cook food with the vegetables they\u2019ve picked up that they then serve for free. The people that were in the community garden were mostly people that live in the neighborhood and use the garden regularly. FnB wants to serve food to homeless, but food is not a very big problem for homeless in Barcelona, its mostly shelter and care, and they will accept the food if its given to them but they don\u2019t come to the community garden. On Monday the 28 th we showed up without any claims, just observing and collaborating in order to understand better and then make our own ideas and opinions. About the community who showed up to eat, some of them were friendly, wanted to talk and communicate, some other were just not. I think it takes time to build trust, to manage to gain confidence. While we were cooking, many people from Raval were just sitting down, waiting, or minding their own business in Agor\u00e0. There is not much of cooperation and participation. One of the main goals of FoodNotBombs is also to create a strong and supportive community, so we thought that a nice way to engage the people with each other and with the organization would be to give them something to do together, that creates closeness and dialogue. Design challenges and opportunity: We will go again and we decided to collaborate with them. We observed that the leftover food that they cooked get delivered to homeless people in the neighborhood in not recyclable doggy bags. Also, they expressed the desire to try to connect with other organization in order to wide their web of contacts and opportunities. Are there other shops that we can connect FNB with? Or other shops that are not giving food away, that we can connect with other organizations so that all shops give away the food? Can we help to develop these connections? Can we bond with the people that show up? Can we create a sense of community? Check our experience here Conclusions Explore other ways of using food waste. They have issues with takeaway products to deliver food to people in need outside of Agora. Material creation for possible use of packaging. Increase the \u2018value\u2019 of food and its journey beyond the kitchen. How can the community be involved in the process to close the loop? Can we connect FoodnotBombs with other organizations/ people to collaborate and help more people in a larger span of locations? Third Intervention \u00b6 El Doble event Bring difficult topic at the table is never easy. We looked for a delicate but effective way to do that and it happened thanks to the collaborations with El Doble, a tiny tapas restaurant in El Born. We knew the chef of the restaurants and at first we were just asking him to collect the food waste so we could use it for our personal tasks. He started being interested in our project and we decided to make an event: a tapas dinner at the restaurant, where people could order ordinary food from the menu and get some tasting of food cooked with scraps. The chef explained all the recipes, how he reused the unwanted item. There was a part of the room dedicated to posters where people could read, reply and interact with our questions. Conclusions An entertaining way to bring up difficult topics. Communicative way to show how to use all parts of vegetables. Educating in a fun way. Good discussion starter. Nice way to bring people together. Intervention development \u00b6 Bio Materials In a regenerative design optic, we applied the intention of waste reuse to materials, as a further way to give value back. Using up all the connections that we made during the other project, we started collected even more food waste like coffee grounds from Itnig, eggshells and orange peels from a caf\u00e8. We decided to explore the possibilities of the waste in another field, with the aim of achieving something that could be actually used again. Different components Different textures Different strength Conclusions Opens the mad scientist and almost childlike behavior while getting creative with the process. Measure twice, mix once. One recipe, many variables, even more possible outcomes. It\u2019s all about the texture. You can mix and match and use everything from your waste. How can materials be used as a channel to communicate difficult issues? Materials are not regenerative, but the way that they are used can be. The Use of AI \u00b6 What do we perceive as waste & why? How did we end up looking at things as something we want to discard instead of looking at it for what it is and seeing the possibilities we have in front of us? What is value? How do we value things/food/waste? Why? In order to give an answer to these questions, we decided to explore the cultural, behavioral and political part of waste. The comparison with AI helped out through the process. The AI model did not recognize any of the peels, the scraps, the leftovers, the rotten veggies as we do, but just as items. It did not add a negative connotation to them but just recognize them as their value. It is a matter of education and perception. During the Design Dialogues, we used it as a tool to gather datas and to interact with people.","title":"Interventions"},{"location":"design_studio_food/01-first%20intervention/#an-intervention","text":"Waste cookers: Sami, Ramiro, Josephine, June, Marc, Claudia Are we aware of how much food we waste?

This causes a dispossession of culturally important foods to traditional users. Generally speaking, usually this happens when the white middle and upper classes are immersed in alternative food networks and so they impose privileged visions of food access, causing a detriment to minorities and lower income classes. In the last ten years North America and Europe have been overwhelmed by a \u201cgreen wave\u201d, that caused a big and positive change in many fields, bringing people to a new awareness and concern about sustainability. This trend of sustainability helps spreading its values, but has also many downsides (greenwashing is probably the biggest example). The \u201cgreen wave\u201d has brought many positive outcomes in the we approach to food and in the way we eat. It is more easy and common to find vegetarian and vegan options in restaurant for instance, or we are all more aware how much water and supplies do meat industries need and how they actually treat animals. But probably we\u2019re not so aware about the negative consequences of this huge and sudden change in the way we approach to food. Just to be clear, I\u2019m not against it, I just would love that everyone trusted the market a little less, because the greenwashing happens everywhere and in any possible way, and nowadays for many producers this sustainable approach is not an ethic but just a way to make money. The most common example of a trendy green food that has huge social consequences is avocado, that nowadays can be also called the \u201cgreen gold\u201d and that causes many conflicts in South America, but we keep having our avocados on toast thinking to be very healthy, green and bio (just a very small number of people know the actual meaning of \u201cbio\u201d and they use it as a label for everything). I decided to bring quinoa as a case study, after traveling around Per\u00f9 for more than a month, hiking a lot and being in deep contact with small and local communities, so after having the chance of eye-witnessing how much traditional users actually depend on quinoa. They have it almost for every meal, mostly cooked in a soup. Quinoa from being a local food, integral to indigenous people from Andes, suddenly became a burgeoning global food commodity, a statement to say \u201clook, I eat healthy and respect my body\u201d. Local users cook it very differently from the way we do in Europe, so beside the dispossession there is also traditional misreading and disrespect. The global prices for the crop are rising and becoming unaffordable for traditional users, and as in most of the industrialized processes rural communities are always the most vulnerable participants, so even if they own the food, they get least benefits from it. My personal fight is to become more aware in the way I eat, try to be more critic and analyze deeply what is sold by industries, try to go deeper and understand the world in a wider scale, not just stopping to my personal interests and comforts. I wanna be fully conscious of the social and environmental consequences of my actions. In my opinion, being more local as possible, when it is possible, is a very good way to fight extreme globalized and gentrified food. We have to learn more where food comes from, what consequences does it have, and also acquire a knowledge about what does the ground where we live can provide to us. We should count on proximity life, buy in local shops and small scale producers, also to support them. My fight starts with me, I wanna educate myself in order to involve and generate interest, and, hopefully, a change.","title":"Bootcamp"},{"location":"temr1/00-Bootcamp/#my-fight","text":"Food Gentrification happens when an affordable and staple ingredient suddenly becomes, in another side of the world, very cool, trendy, costly and then out of reach for poorer communities that depended on that specific ingredient or food.

Honey bees get stressed \u00b6 Why honey bees get stressed? And what are the consequences? Stress : noun // A state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or demanding circumstance. // Great worry caused by a difficult situation, or something that causes this condition. // Physiological concept that allows organisms to respond to adverse environmental pressures. And yes, not just humans and other mammals can feel stressed, but also honey bees. The articles that I want to discuss claims that Bees get stressed at work too and it might be causing colony collapse , (published in June 2018 by The Conversation). That animals feel emotions and moods we can take for granted: emotions is not just an internal awareness of a feeling, but also a physical and behavior change. The emotional life of animals, insects and specifically bees has been studied for a long time, and it showed impressive results: bees don\u2019t experience human-like emotions, but it feels like something to be an insect. Some recent studies by Geraldine Wright at Newcastle University in the UK have showed that honeybees may experience something akin to moods. They proved that bees show a state of negative affect triggered by agitation, \u201cassociated with system-wide changes in neurotransmitters and causes clear, measurable cognitive biases\u201d . But what does cause stress to honey bees? Stress in bees has been studied throughout the reaction of multiple aspects as behavioral, physiological or cellular stress responses. And, as it happens to human, stressors affect the immune system, causing ripple effect. Here are some causes of stress in honey bees. The shape of the hive can be a cause: Open Source Beehives designed a hive that encourages happiness for health bees, by reducing the stress. The shape of common hives aim to maximize the honey production. This one instead allow bees to build their combs in more natural curving shapes. Also, when a parasite infect the hive, they produce a warning pheromone to communicate the danger to each other, and this pheromone itself cause a social stress. But if the threat is bigger than a parasite, let\u2019s say a big animal, or a human, the bees are gonna produce a bigger quantity of pheromone. Yes, bees are social insects and as most of them they use pheromone to communicate! Insects have been using pheromones for communications throughout evolutionary history. Chemical communication help insects to be organized inside the colonies. \u201cIf the social harmony gets disrupted, it can cause colony collapse, meaning complete dysfunction of the hive.\u201d Christopher Mayack says. What is this pheromone? Bees release it when they sting, when they\u2019re killed, to take care of other individuals, but they use it also to mark flowers after they removed the nectar. It is basically a call to action used for collective decision making and rapid communication in the community. And it can work in a repelling or attracting way. Another cause of stress is the intense foraging . Honey bees develop and change many jobs during their working like: they start brood nursing, cleaning and food storing, then they might get a promotion to be a guardian of the hive entrance against intruders and predators. But the major event is when they have to work in foraging for food sources. This big jump to foraging corresponds to hormonal and physiology changes, and that\u2019s because foraging requires a lot: it is the activity that exposes bees to most stressful situation, that requires the biggest amount of energies and exposes the insect to new environments. \u201dOctopamine is two to four times more abundant in brains of forager than those of nurse bees\u201d . Octopamine is a neurotransmitter that basically works as prompter of dynamic actions to the organism and help honey bees to deal with the stress of foraging. And what are the consequences of stressed honey bees? Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is the answer. This syndrome has been affecting honey bees increasingly over the past 15 years and is \u201cthe result of an accumulation of stressors chronically weakening honey bee colonies\u201d . This phenomenon happen when the working bees disappear and leave the queen and some nurse bees alone in the hive. The Colony Collapse Disorder in a very complex syndrome with many causes, but stress is one of them. The stressors that are causing an increase in honey bee colony failure rates are multiples: diseases, parasites, pesticides and poor nutrition for instance. But we don\u2019t have just direct threats that are causing this issue, but also the so called \u201csublethal stressors\u201d which don\u2019t directly kill bees, but harm them or make them change behavior. In other words: fumes and pesticides disturb chemical communication in honey bees\u2019s brains. This means just one thing: empty hives. Other reasons are related to the CCD as poor nutrition, pathogens, parasites and pests and many actions are being taken into consideration in order to protect honey bees and pollinators (wild bees too are in danger and very important for the environment.) The best thing that the public can take is not to use pesticides randomly and help them out by planting pollinator friendly plants as foxglove, bee balm, red clover and other plants! P.S.

The first person perceptive is a way of acting, of looking at things, of being involved. It is a way to act and react. It has challenges, scales and rules in order to understand myself in context: my boundaries, my limits and my possibilities. In order to be more in tune. My Companion During today\u2019s class Kristina Anderson gave us the task to build in 10 minutes a companion with wasted material that we brought from home. This companion is supposed to satisfy a desire: CURIOSITY, the need to gain knowledge. I built Nadir. Here she is. Nadir and I are gonna live together pretty easily. I will wear her when I\u2019m awake and active, and when I\u2019m not she still will be, producing light, and will stay next to my bed. She\u2019s my companion and her aim in life is to bring curiosity and help me out to gain knowledge. Basically she\u2019s a boredom clock for me: until her light runs, I will try to achieve the most I can from my everyday life, she\u2019s there to remind me not to procrastinate, to explore, to experience also when I feel that I\u2019m stuck in my routine. Also, I will constantly have to check if her light is still on so I will always have an eye on her. That\u2019s our pact: I\u2019ll take care of her and in exchange she will be a life curiosity reminder for me. When I build her, her light guided me: I started without a specific idea and then I ended up building an altar for her and also making her wearable for me, in order to be in touch and actual contact with her. She matters for me because I noticed that since I moved to Barcelona I\u2019m experiencing newness a lot, and I don\u2019t wanna stop, so to me it\u2019s meaningful to give a shape to this idea and willing. After 41 hours Nadir still works, her light is still on. This really surprised me cause due to her old age I thought she would have not survived more than 24 hours. But here she still is, and hopefully she\u2019ll survive even longer. She fulfilled her main function: any time that I looked at her she was helping to actually using up the spare time that I\u2019ve had available in the last days and I actually didn\u2019t procrastinate in any of the things that I wanted to do. Spending time with her during the night and during the time that I was home alone (my flatmate is not in Barcelona right now) made me realize another important meaning that she has for me. I truly felt her as a companion: I felt more comfortable walking around Barcelona in the dark and less lonely while I was home alone Tuesday night. She started by being just an object with a specific function, so it was very surprising to discover that she is way more than that (and also she\u2019s something more than I designer her to be). I feel that I\u2019m surrounded by objects all the time, but they just mean their function to me. Nadir managed to be more than her function. She truly helped with time and boredom management, she motivated me and kept me company. I was a bit skeptical about her actual meaning in my life but it worked out well. 24 HOURS How can I take action on my concept in a brave way? How can I immerse myself into the topic of wasted food? I should feel an experience. I should live the topic from the inside and explore it in a first person perceptive. The food waste problem has many facets and can be faced up to in different ways. My brain started running ideas of how I could get more involved in the problem but eventually I ended up with a decision and that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do: My area of acting is Raval, the neighborhood where I live. I noticed that in Raval, being neighboring La Rambla has many food accesses and options. Not just restaurants and food chains for tourists but also groceries for local people. For 24 hours I will just eat food that\u2019s supposed to be thrown away by groceries, bakeries, bars\u2026 I will go around and just ask if they have some food (any kind) that they would toss at the end of the day. How did it go? See the video here What they offered me: Especially in fruterias they offered me way more food that I needed, but I knew I could not eat it all so I picked a little. For instance they offered me two huge boxes of zucchini, a whole box full of tomatoes and carrots. Also, they told me to come back the morning after to collect more. Some places like bars and caf\u00e8 told me that they do Too Good To Go (which is a great way to save wasted food) and so I made the decision not to get food from them. I decided also to avoid big chains like supermarkets of caf\u00e8 because they couldn\u2019t give me any explanation on where the wasted food would go (that\u2019s because the people I talked to were employees and not responsible for the shop). I focused more on local groceries so that I could get in touch directly to owners. What I collected: One pain au chocolat, two boccadillos with jamon, three zucchini, seven bananas, one pear, eight carrots, one croissant with ham and cheese. What I ate: breakfast: pan au chocolat lunch: croissant with ham and cheese, zucchini and banana snack: a pear, and I baked a banana bread dinner: zucchini and boccadillo with jamon I managed to eat more than enough, very healthy and very good too. Didn\u2019t expect it at all. Some reflection I think that when you start to involve yourself in the process you actually understand the process better.

The first person perceptive is a way of acting, of looking at things, of being involved. It is a way to act and react. It has challenges, scales and rules in order to understand myself in context: my boundaries, my limits and my possibilities. In order to be more in tune. My Companion During today\u2019s class Kristina Anderson gave us the task to build in 10 minutes a companion with wasted material that we brought from home. This companion is supposed to satisfy a desire: CURIOSITY, the need to gain knowledge. I built Nadir. Here she is. Nadir and I are gonna live together pretty easily. I will wear her when I\u2019m awake and active, and when I\u2019m not she still will be, producing light, and will stay next to my bed. She\u2019s my companion and her aim in life is to bring curiosity and help me out to gain knowledge. Basically she\u2019s a boredom clock for me: until her light runs, I will try to achieve the most I can from my everyday life, she\u2019s there to remind me not to procrastinate, to explore, to experience also when I feel that I\u2019m stuck in my routine. Also, I will constantly have to check if her light is still on so I will always have an eye on her. That\u2019s our pact: I\u2019ll take care of her and in exchange she will be a life curiosity reminder for me. When I build her, her light guided me: I started without a specific idea and then I ended up building an altar for her and also making her wearable for me, in order to be in touch and actual contact with her. She matters for me because I noticed that since I moved to Barcelona I\u2019m experiencing newness a lot, and I don\u2019t wanna stop, so to me it\u2019s meaningful to give a shape to this idea and willing. After 41 hours Nadir still works, her light is still on. This really surprised me cause due to her old age I thought she would have not survived more than 24 hours. But here she still is, and hopefully she\u2019ll survive even longer. She fulfilled her main function: any time that I looked at her she was helping to actually using up the spare time that I\u2019ve had available in the last days and I actually didn\u2019t procrastinate in any of the things that I wanted to do. Spending time with her during the night and during the time that I was home alone (my flatmate is not in Barcelona right now) made me realize another important meaning that she has for me. I truly felt her as a companion: I felt more comfortable walking around Barcelona in the dark and less lonely while I was home alone Tuesday night. She started by being just an object with a specific function, so it was very surprising to discover that she is way more than that (and also she\u2019s something more than I designer her to be). I feel that I\u2019m surrounded by objects all the time, but they just mean their function to me. Nadir managed to be more than her function. She truly helped with time and boredom management, she motivated me and kept me company. I was a bit skeptical about her actual meaning in my life but it worked out well. 24 HOURS How can I take action on my concept in a brave way? How can I immerse myself into the topic of wasted food? I should feel an experience. I should live the topic from the inside and explore it in a first person perceptive. The food waste problem has many facets and can be faced up to in different ways. My brain started running ideas of how I could get more involved in the problem but eventually I ended up with a decision and that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do: My area of acting is Raval, the neighborhood where I live. I noticed that in Raval, being neighboring La Rambla has many food accesses and options. Not just restaurants and food chains for tourists but also groceries for local people. For 24 hours I will just eat food that\u2019s supposed to be thrown away by groceries, bakeries, bars\u2026 I will go around and just ask if they have some food (any kind) that they would toss at the end of the day.

Creative Community \u00b6 Context: \u201cSolitude is fine but you need someone to tell you that\u201d Honor\u00e8 de Balzac. The context that I decided to explore is the loneliness and solitude developed in the small towns of 5 Terre in Liguria, Italy. During the summer 5 Terre are victims of mass tourism and they get overcrowded and over populated, but as soon as the temperature drops and it becomes cold, they are lived by average 1000 citizens per town, excluded Corniglia that just has 195 citizens. Current situation: Life in the winter is tough. Most of the population run jobs related to tourism, so they don\u2019t work in the winter. Life is always the same, and with the excuse of \u201cresting\u201d and that the town doesn\u2019t offer much, most of the people just end up in self isolation at home. Everyone knows each other and there are no impulses from the outside world, not many changes to explore and not many reasons to go out, to actually interact with each other. People feel like they already know each other, since that they grew up and lived in small towns, that we can consider like communities. Nothing\u2019s new, nothing to do, nothing to say. Engagements and limits: the first limit is that changing habits is hard. That\u2019s it. The engagements that can work with this kind of limit is to create an impulse, a color, a small change. But it has to arrive from people, for people. Since that we would operate in a small town, I would keep the small approach and think small. Another limit is also the different ages of the people we want to cooperate and work for. The habitants go from kids to grandparents. Theory of change: try to increase the amount of human encounters with simple tools that everyone can easily access to and integrate to the every day life. A tool that people could use to show approachable and happy to engage in a brief chat, conversation, or share a moment with a cup of tea. A simple sign that I can put outside my door, or I can comfortably wear when I go out, that tells everyone that I\u2019m up for a chat, for a coffee, or for a walk together. We could even develop a language of shape and colors that show different interests. (like green dot to go on a walk, yellow dot to go groceries together etc etc\u2026) Design challenges and opportunity: since that not everyone is comfortable with smart phones and technology, the tool must be physical, tangible, practical. Also, it must speak an open language that everyone can understand, maybe a symbol, like a dot or a square that becomes a mutual meaning for the whole community to read.

I would wake up very early to take, each day, a picture of the sunrise, to continue my research on how much the colours of the sunrise change in each season and year. Then home made yogurt and granola, while listening to the news (a podcast). When in the city, just moving around by bike and public transportation, going to the eco social design collective where I work, and enjoying the time with my colleagues, and after going out for drinks together once in a while, or music, events, or cinema, paying with my phone. Cash is not a thing anymore. In the island walking barefoot, go to the beach, collect food from trees, cook, doing ceramic and explore. I don\u2019t use money on the island, just barter and exchange. I don\u2019t use either phone or watch. Time is dictated by the sun and personal needs. Eating when hungry, going to sleep when tired.","title":"Designing for the Next Billion Seconds"},{"location":"temr2/data/","text":"Measuring the World \u00b6 Making tools for data collection that don\u2019t extract data from humans, being able to turn data into informations for humans, created by humans.

It takes a lot of time but it\u2019s oddly satisfying to watch I have to admit. MICRO CHALLENGE WEEK We wanna help people to communicate their ideas, opinion and experience about drugs without using the voice, by creating a tool that could help them speak without speaking. Why? Because sometimes seems hard to talk and express opinions about specific topics, if it feels like they are being denied by society and there\u2019s no enough freedom to bring the conversation to the table, and especially to share a personal experience, positive or negative an habit or even an addiction related to something illegal and usually misread. The lack of communication and dialogue in the topic brings a huge lack of awareness and information in the topic itself. Also, sharing can prevent other people\u2019s harm. We want people to feel comfortable in sharing personal opinions about drugs, that\u2019s why we designed a simple tool, a sharing board, that it\u2019s seen multiple times in different occasions, as a way to normalise the topic. We wanna give a non judgmental tool to gather data about drug use in different locations (street, music festival, bars, uni). We designed the board starting by a topography map to give a modularity aspect and not to limit ourselves with a squared board. Also, the shapes of the topography allows to create different shapes and adjust the board by preference.Once that the shapes were fixed we developed a flow of answers that could represent statements related to drug and then we placed them in the rhino file. We first prototyped the board in cardboard to test it out and then we laser cut it on plywood. The whole board that starts with a question: \u201cDo you do drugs?\u201d The YES and NO answers correspond to a thread and then the journey begins as a flow of answers to communicate personal opinions and experiences. Close to each answer we put a nail were a thread can be attached as a \u201cyes I do\u201d. THE INVISIBLE ANSWERS We know that being honest, with themselves and others, about drugs is not easy, so in order to allow people to feel more comfortable about sharing we came up with the idea of the invisible answers, more intimate and difficult statements that might be hard to point out in front of others. These answers are not laser cut in the board, instead we printed weird shaped stickers (that are connected to aesthetic of the project) on blue vinyl and then sticked them on the board. Using an augmented reality development package and ARKit, we then developed an app which allows you to individually scan each icon (stickers), and in return, the app displays the \u201cinvisible answers\u201d on your phone. The app however, is limited to individual deployment, thus we have to deploy it on each IOS device by building it through XCode. Having said that, the code is currently limited to IOS builds. So eventually each participant could feel like living in an open space where to share, even more intimate and private stuff related to drugs. This project is part of a wider project called DRUGS YOU BETTER KNOW that soon will try to participate to a Sonar open call for artistic and technological projects working at the intersection between art, technology, sciences, and society, aiming for ideas that see the development of AI, VR, AR. We\u2019re also developing a VR immersive experience to break walls of prejudice and conservatism to open dialogue and reduce drug harms at festivals. 3D PRINTING First experiment with the 3d printer, modelled a volcano try with Rhino, embedded it in Cura and finally 3D printed it.

I\u2019m surrounded by it. Silver has the highest known electrical and thermal conductivity of all metals. It\u2019s shiny, it tarnishes slowly in air because the sulfur reacts with the surface creating a black silver sulfide. The more you wear silver, the less you would have to clean it to remove the sulfide. Also, it has antibacterial properties, which open up to medical uses. We can say that the main properties are electrical conductivity and decorative beauty. The silver that is used for jewellery is called sterling silver and contains 92.5% silver, the rest is usually other metals. Silver is also used for tableware, for mirrors, batteries, electrical contacts and medical alloys. The nano parts are used in the clothing industry for touchscreen fingertips. It\u2019s a materials that was also very important in the development of film photography because the silver bromide is sensible to light. Also, in history it was used in the manufacture of coins. Silver was started to be mined around 3000 BC and the material was refined by heating it up in a shallow cup, so that other materials like copper would oxidate. In Medieval, German mines were the most effective source of Silver in Europe. Material from reference: slime molds from Dasha Plesen Chose it because it makes me believe in parallel words, futures and opens up my imaginations. Bacteria and organism that create funny shades and colours in around 4 weeks. They are eukaryotic organism which create spores. They were before classified as fungi but now switched to the group of Protista. All around the world, we can classify more than 900 species of molds. They feed on bacteria, fungi and microorganism that live on dead plant that\u2019s why they contribute to decomposition. We can find them in soil, lawns, fruits, forest ground but also in leaf mold in rain gutters and in air conditioners. Fun facts: they are saprophytic and lack chlorophyll. They are all harmless cause non toxic and actually beneficial, especially for the soil because they return nutriment to it. Unfortunately, sometimes they can be seen as dirty or toxic because of the smell that they produce, but it\u2019s because the tip of the stalk is covered with slime spores that attract flies. Ideal Material: CHOLT Chose it because I wish it existed, especially these days cause it\u2019s pretty cold in Barcelona and I have my heating system broken. The name Cholt speaks for itself: it\u2019s the combination of hot and cold. Why? Because this material keeps a neutral temperature of 15 degrees but when it touch with very cold or hot surfaces (body, other materials and so on\u2026) it manages to balance that out by raising or lowering its own temperature. Examples: when your feet are really cold, as soon as Cholt is in touch with them it become 30 degrees. When your face is really hot in the summer it becomes 0 degrees. The Cholt looks like wool, it comes in yarns so that people can create the shape that feet them better. It\u2019s very soft and resistant thanks to the conductive fibers inside. Scientists (me, myself and I) are trying to study further application of the material to fight climate change or environmental disasters, and try to adapt the shape to a larger scale. SHELLAC RESEARCH PROJECT Can there be a bio alternative to silicon? Exploring bio based alternatives to silicone as a sealant and adhesive. Silicone or polysiloxane is a polymer made of siloxane that is typically colourless with oil or rubber-like properties. Silicones are used in sealants, adhesives, lubricants, medicine, cooking utensils, thermal insulation, and electrical insulation. It is used in large scale production and manufacturing generating large toxic substances. When speaking with experts, we identified Shellac as a potential alternative. Shellac is a natural, organic resin from the insect, Laccifera lacca. During the insects reproductive cycle it feeds on the sap from certain trees indigenous to India and Thailand and secretes an amber coloured resinous substance that is called \u201clac\u201d. The resin forms a cocoon around the insect which serves to incubate the eggs she lays. This cocoon is the raw material for shellac and is called \u201csticklac\u201d, because it contains resin, parts of the twig and bug remains. The sticklac is washed and then refined either chemically or by hand, to produce the raw material available. Shellac has been used for multiple purposes as sealants and adhesive throughout history. Through innovations of synthetic adhesives and sealants such as silicone etc the use of shellac is mostly as wood and furniture finish and conserving and restoring antiques. Commercially it is also used pharmaceutically, in confectionery and food coatings because of its FDA approval, shellac is used to coat apples and other fruits to make them shinier. EXPERIMENTS & INTERESTS Could shellac be used as a water resistant bio material as an alternative to silicone? Can it be used as an adhesive? What properties can it have as a sealant? Can it be completely waterproof? Can it be extruded? Can it be reused? Can it be used to glaze clay Can it be used as a glue for broken clay (kintsugi) RECIPE I 10g shellac 50ml alcohol 96% Heat until shellac flakes dissolve Very fluid and liquid consistence at first, then while getting cold it thickened and became more solid. REFLECTIONS Depending on the materials that are glued, the shellac as an adhesive has different properties. Between two pieces of synthetic fabric it creates and bond and the material becomes sturdier. Between dried leaves it has bonding properties, but takes longer to dry and is elastic. It\u2019s hard to apply and manipulate as it has a quick drying time for application, although if reheated or kept heated it is easily applicable RECIPE I 10g shellac 50ml alcohol 96% Heat until shellac flakes dissolve Very fluid and liquid consistence at first, then while getting cold it thickened and became more solid. REFLECTIONS With one layer of shellac between two pieces of fabric it glues them together making the material sturdier. It creates a water resistant surface, but after a while the water can pass through the material. Test more layers of shellac RECIPE II 10g shellac 10ml alcohol Heat until shellac flakes dissolve Apply between materials Post heat with flame REFLECTIONS It had a very thick consistency and dried quickly making it difficult to work with. Between two pieces of dry porcelain dough it became more hard and acted as a strong binder. Connecting two pieces of Casein Bio Material as a kintsugi principle it has an elastic texture. If post heating with an open flame it hardens and binds pieces together RECIPE II 10g shellac 10ml alcohol Heat until shellac flakes dissolve Apply between materials Post heat with flame REFLECTIONS We used the shellac as we would have with silicone to seal cracks and holes in a plastic container. It works to seal from water when dry which took 2 days to dry completely. The aesthetics are not as pleasing, especially when on a white container as this one. RECIPE III 10g shellac 30ml alcohol Heat until shellac flakes dissolve Apply between materials Post heat with flame REFLECTIONS It had a thick consistency where we experimented with connecting pieces of clay using the shellac as a sealer. To connect two pieces both sides had to have a layer of Shellac, thereafter they easily stick together. It was again possible to reheat the Shellac while in place on the clay to move the pieces and then harden it into place. This could be a great way to connect pieces. We also wanted to experiment with adding a thin layer to the clay to investigate if it created a water resistant layer, though the mixture was here too thick and did not stick to large surfaces in clay. RECIPE III 10g shellac 30ml alcohol Heat until shellac flakes dissolve Apply between materials Post heat with flame REFLECTIONS Experimenting with casting Shellac and exploring thicker properties. Although the mixture was very thin when heated it formed well in a mould and when dry, which took 2 days, it has shock absorbing, rubber like properties. Are there other alternatives to glue and silicone? Water resistant or water proof? Our main ambition was to find a water resistant, waterproof and gluey material that could be an alternative to silicone. We experimented with shellac as a bio substitute for silicon and explored the material with several properties and materials. As results, we used the material on fabrics, raw clay, leaves, bio materials and plastic. We managed to achieve some of the properties that we were aiming for, but struggling with the manageability of shellac, as a material that changes consistence very fast as the temperature lows, and with the resistance of our achievements. This experience was really important as part of a bigger project that see us working with water and exploring (probably clay) modules to collect and filter water and grow stuff. We will further be exploring recipes with low temperature for less alcohol smell and experimenting with making water repellent clay without firing.","title":"Remixing Materials"},{"location":"temr2/remix/#remixing-materials","text":"Material around me: SILVER I chose silver because I wear it every day on my fingers, on my ears, on my nipple and on my belly. I\u2019m surrounded by it. Silver has the highest known electrical and thermal conductivity of all metals. It\u2019s shiny, it tarnishes slowly in air because the sulfur reacts with the surface creating a black silver sulfide. The more you wear silver, the less you would have to clean it to remove the sulfide. Also, it has antibacterial properties, which open up to medical uses. We can say that the main properties are electrical conductivity and decorative beauty. The silver that is used for jewellery is called sterling silver and contains 92.5% silver, the rest is usually other metals. Silver is also used for tableware, for mirrors, batteries, electrical contacts and medical alloys. The nano parts are used in the clothing industry for touchscreen fingertips. It\u2019s a materials that was also very important in the development of film photography because the silver bromide is sensible to light. Also, in history it was used in the manufacture of coins. Silver was started to be mined around 3000 BC and the material was refined by heating it up in a shallow cup, so that other materials like copper would oxidate. In Medieval, German mines were the most effective source of Silver in Europe. Material from reference: slime molds from Dasha Plesen Chose it because it makes me believe in parallel words, futures and opens up my imaginations. Bacteria and organism that create funny shades and colours in around 4 weeks. They are eukaryotic organism which create spores. They were before classified as fungi but now switched to the group of Protista. All around the world, we can classify more than 900 species of molds. They feed on bacteria, fungi and microorganism that live on dead plant that\u2019s why they contribute to decomposition. We can find them in soil, lawns, fruits, forest ground but also in leaf mold in rain gutters and in air conditioners. Fun facts: they are saprophytic and lack chlorophyll. They are all harmless cause non toxic and actually beneficial, especially for the soil because they return nutriment to it. Unfortunately, sometimes they can be seen as dirty or toxic because of the smell that they produce, but it\u2019s because the tip of the stalk is covered with slime spores that attract flies. Ideal Material: CHOLT Chose it because I wish it existed, especially these days cause it\u2019s pretty cold in Barcelona and I have my heating system broken. The name Cholt speaks for itself: it\u2019s the combination of hot and cold. Why? Because this material keeps a neutral temperature of 15 degrees but when it touch with very cold or hot surfaces (body, other materials and so on\u2026) it manages to balance that out by raising or lowering its own temperature. Examples: when your feet are really cold, as soon as Cholt is in touch with them it become 30 degrees. When your face is really hot in the summer it becomes 0 degrees. The Cholt looks like wool, it comes in yarns so that people can create the shape that feet them better. It\u2019s very soft and resistant thanks to the conductive fibers inside. Scientists (me, myself and I) are trying to study further application of the material to fight climate change or environmental disasters, and try to adapt the shape to a larger scale. SHELLAC RESEARCH PROJECT Can there be a bio alternative to silicon? Exploring bio based alternatives to silicone as a sealant and adhesive. Silicone or polysiloxane is a polymer made of siloxane that is typically colourless with oil or rubber-like properties. Silicones are used in sealants, adhesives, lubricants, medicine, cooking utensils, thermal insulation, and electrical insulation. It is used in large scale production and manufacturing generating large toxic substances. When speaking with experts, we identified Shellac as a potential alternative. Shellac is a natural, organic resin from the insect, Laccifera lacca. During the insects reproductive cycle it feeds on the sap from certain trees indigenous to India and Thailand and secretes an amber coloured resinous substance that is called \u201clac\u201d. The resin forms a cocoon around the insect which serves to incubate the eggs she lays. This cocoon is the raw material for shellac and is called \u201csticklac\u201d, because it contains resin, parts of the twig and bug remains. The sticklac is washed and then refined either chemically or by hand, to produce the raw material available. Shellac has been used for multiple purposes as sealants and adhesive throughout history. Through innovations of synthetic adhesives and sealants such as silicone etc the use of shellac is mostly as wood and furniture finish and conserving and restoring antiques. Commercially it is also used pharmaceutically, in confectionery and food coatings because of its FDA approval, shellac is used to coat apples and other fruits to make them shinier. EXPERIMENTS & INTERESTS Could shellac be used as a water resistant bio material as an alternative to silicone? Can it be used as an adhesive? What properties can it have as a sealant? Can it be completely waterproof? Can it be extruded? Can it be reused? Can it be used to glaze clay Can it be used as a glue for broken clay (kintsugi) RECIPE I 10g shellac 50ml alcohol 96% Heat until shellac flakes dissolve Very fluid and liquid consistence at first, then while getting cold it thickened and became more solid. REFLECTIONS Depending on the materials that are glued, the shellac as an adhesive has different properties. Between two pieces of synthetic fabric it creates and bond and the material becomes sturdier. Between dried leaves it has bonding properties, but takes longer to dry and is elastic. It\u2019s hard to apply and manipulate as it has a quick drying time for application, although if reheated or kept heated it is easily applicable RECIPE I 10g shellac 50ml alcohol 96% Heat until shellac flakes dissolve Very fluid and liquid consistence at first, then while getting cold it thickened and became more solid. REFLECTIONS With one layer of shellac between two pieces of fabric it glues them together making the material sturdier. It creates a water resistant surface, but after a while the water can pass through the material. Test more layers of shellac RECIPE II 10g shellac 10ml alcohol Heat until shellac flakes dissolve Apply between materials Post heat with flame REFLECTIONS It had a very thick consistency and dried quickly making it difficult to work with. Between two pieces of dry porcelain dough it became more hard and acted as a strong binder. Connecting two pieces of Casein Bio Material as a kintsugi principle it has an elastic texture. If post heating with an open flame it hardens and binds pieces together RECIPE II 10g shellac 10ml alcohol Heat until shellac flakes dissolve Apply between materials Post heat with flame REFLECTIONS We used the shellac as we would have with silicone to seal cracks and holes in a plastic container. It works to seal from water when dry which took 2 days to dry completely. The aesthetics are not as pleasing, especially when on a white container as this one. RECIPE III 10g shellac 30ml alcohol Heat until shellac flakes dissolve Apply between materials Post heat with flame REFLECTIONS It had a thick consistency where we experimented with connecting pieces of clay using the shellac as a sealer. To connect two pieces both sides had to have a layer of Shellac, thereafter they easily stick together. It was again possible to reheat the Shellac while in place on the clay to move the pieces and then harden it into place. This could be a great way to connect pieces. We also wanted to experiment with adding a thin layer to the clay to investigate if it created a water resistant layer, though the mixture was here too thick and did not stick to large surfaces in clay. RECIPE III 10g shellac 30ml alcohol Heat until shellac flakes dissolve Apply between materials Post heat with flame REFLECTIONS Experimenting with casting Shellac and exploring thicker properties. Although the mixture was very thin when heated it formed well in a mould and when dry, which took 2 days, it has shock absorbing, rubber like properties.
