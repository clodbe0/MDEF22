This causes a dispossession of culturally important foods to traditional users. Generally speaking, usually this happens when the white middle and upper classes are immersed in alternative food networks and so they impose privileged visions of food access, causing a detriment to minorities and lower income classes. In the last ten years North America and Europe have been overwhelmed by a \u201cgreen wave\u201d, that caused a big and positive change in many fields, bringing people to a new awareness and concern about sustainability. This trend of sustainability helps spreading its values, but has also many downsides (greenwashing is probably the biggest example). The \u201cgreen wave\u201d has brought many positive outcomes in the we approach to food and in the way we eat. It is more easy and common to find vegetarian and vegan options in restaurant for instance, or we are all more aware how much water and supplies do meat industries need and how they actually treat animals. But probably we\u2019re not so aware about the negative consequences of this huge and sudden change in the way we approach to food. Just to be clear, I\u2019m not against it, I just would love that everyone trusted the market a little less, because the greenwashing happens everywhere and in any possible way, and nowadays for many producers this sustainable approach is not an ethic but just a way to make money. The most common example of a trendy green food that has huge social consequences is avocado, that nowadays can be also called the \u201cgreen gold\u201d and that causes many conflicts in South America, but we keep having our avocados on toast thinking to be very healthy, green and bio (just a very small number of people know the actual meaning of \u201cbio\u201d and they use it as a label for everything). I decided to bring quinoa as a case study, after traveling around Per\u00f9 for more than a month, hiking a lot and being in deep contact with small and local communities, so after having the chance of eye-witnessing how much traditional users actually depend on quinoa. They have it almost for every meal, mostly cooked in a soup. Quinoa from being a local food, integral to indigenous people from Andes, suddenly became a burgeoning global food commodity, a statement to say \u201clook, I eat healthy and respect my body\u201d. Local users cook it very differently from the way we do in Europe, so beside the dispossession there is also traditional misreading and disrespect. The global prices for the crop are rising and becoming unaffordable for traditional users, and as in most of the industrialized processes rural communities are always the most vulnerable participants, so even if they own the food, they get least benefits from it. My personal fight is to become more aware in the way I eat, try to be more critic and analyze deeply what is sold by industries, try to go deeper and understand the world in a wider scale, not just stopping to my personal interests and comforts. I wanna be fully conscious of the social and environmental consequences of my actions. In my opinion, being more local as possible, when it is possible, is a very good way to fight extreme globalized and gentrified food. We have to learn more where food comes from, what consequences does it have, and also acquire a knowledge about what does the ground where we live can provide to us. We should count on proximity life, buy in local shops and small scale producers, also to support them. My fight starts with me, I wanna educate myself in order to involve and generate interest, and, hopefully, a change.","title":"My fight"},{"location":"temr1/00-My%20fight/#my-fight","text":"Food Gentrification happens when an affordable and staple ingredient suddenly becomes, in another side of the world, very cool, trendy, costly and then out of reach for poorer communities that depended on that specific ingredient or food.

But what is a weak signal? It is an emerging trend or topic that has a potential to become huge. And it can speculate any possible future. We were asked to explore the cards, pick some random ones and then to pick a favorite one: very hard task considering all the interesting cards that we had. It felt impossible to me choosing just one field. Eventually, I went for the field of Design for Anthropocene and chose Climate Conscience. But also Locally Productive Globally Connected truly represents me and my interests, as Design for Social Innovation, Redesigning Habits, Circular Economy or Digital Carbon Footprint. And many other ones. Okay, yes. I\u2019m interested in many topic. We started building our design space using the cards, some case studies and our free reasoning. My design space went through many developments and changes. From \u201chow does what we eat affect the world\u201d to \u201chow to visualize Co2\u201d and then \u201cclay and local materials\u201d. Eventually, what I understood is that the connection in between all of these design spaces is the concept of LOCAL. Eat local, speak local, buy local, learn local. Respect local. Be local. Connect local. Reuse local. From the clay that you use to do pottery to the vegetables that you cook for dinner. This is deeply related to my fight: food gentrification. I deeply believe that eating local is the only way to fight this phenomenom back. Why? To fight ecological crises, to support local producers, to reduce Co2 emissions. To be more in touch with what our land can offer us. To have a deeper experience in a place you go visit cause you truly connect with its native food. To avoid food dispossession in other parts of the world. I live very close to el Mercat de la Boqueria and it\u2019s shocking to me seeing tourists buying imported dragon fruits, ananas and avocados. Why don\u2019t we give more value to local fruits and vegetables? And also to restaurants and shops who offer local commodities? Also, something disturbing to me living in such a touristic area of Barcelona is the food waste that comes from restaurants and street food shops. Under the new bill passed by the Spanish government, restaurants and bars are soon gonna be obliged to offer free doggy bags to take home leftover food. Honestly, never saw that happening. How does Barcelona manage food waste? This is also thinking in local mindset. I think we should put more attention in the whole process of food: where does it come from, how does it arrive to our home, and how easily it becomes waste.

Prototype as a tool for inquiry: I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for, so prototyping is the way to capture infos and learn by provoking and causing reactions. Role 3.

Vehicle for inquiry: it is not the prototype itself, but the process who generates knowledge. The process as a method and a way to discover, so it should be documented. Getting people involved in the process (co-design, participatory design) to explore together. During my short experience as a designer, I got in touch with some of these roles of prototyping. I feel that the Role 1 happened many times when we had to test out any kind of experimental trials like texture, the material itself or colors. Once we had to develop a game made out of recycled materials and after experimenting with a wide range of options we ended up using cardboard to create a book for children, in order to create different texture. Another example that comes to my mind is about the Research archetype . I worked for a couple of years in a ceramic studio and the studio itself was kind of a showroom. It was full of everyday-use ceramics and people could assembly them choosing any possible way they wanted to. This process became many times an inspiration for us, cause we saw assemblings that we just never thought about and that become new ideas for new projects. The role of prototyping that attracts me the most, and that I had the chance to explore the most is the Vehicle for inquiry .
